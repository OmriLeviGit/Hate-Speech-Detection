Just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her.

""I'm a sailor, and we are off to Italy tomorrow. I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take care of you, bring you food every day and keep you happy.""

With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to Italy , the woman accepted.

That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.

From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine and make love to her until dawn.

Two weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.
""What are you doing here?"" asked the captain.
""I have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""He brings me food and I get a free trip to Italy .""
""I see,"" the captain said.
Her conscience got the best of her and she added, ""Plus, he's screwing me.""
""He certainly is,"" replied the captain.

When he's called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Anthony Albanese said, ""Truthfully, I didn't bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I'm the Pwime Minista & leader of the Labour Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, ""Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they'll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I'm sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albanese  snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Andre Agassi came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese , what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Anthony Albanese stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

We're giving local brewers, distillers, and winemakers more support, with tax breaks so they can invest, grow, and create jobs.

We're backing the industry and the jobs it supports.

"So my son had his last day of primary school yesterday. I rocked up for the graduation ceremony to learn that there had been issues with kids writing naughty words on their Year 6 shirts. Of the FU kind.

What unfolded because of those hurty words is astounding. It's a long story but essentially one mum got hunted down by the school for saying those words at a private pre-school breakfast, kids detained for 2.5 hours without food and water, interrogated, shouted at and then denied play time at lunch afterwards. They were then stripped of their graduation medals and the teachers refused to do a farewell speech.

I didn't get a call about it but other parents did.

Does that seem a reasonable response to a few kids writing FU [insert school name] on their shirts?

I've emailed the DoE demanding an investigation into why they fucked up my son's last day of primary school. I copied the principal in so I could fuck up her holidays. Sound fair?"

I experienced the WORST customer service today at a shop. I don't want to mention the name of the shop because I'm not sure how I'm going to proceed. Last night I bought something from this shop. I paid cash for it. I took it home and found out it didn't work. So today, less than 24 hours later I took it back to the shop and asked if I could get a refund. The girl in the shop told me ""NO"" even though I still had the receipt. I asked if I could get a replacement instead then. Again this person told me ""NO."" I asked to talk to a manager now as I'm really not happy and I explained that I had just bought the item, had got it home and it didn't work. The manager just smiled and told me to my face that I was ""OUT OF LUCK."" üò°üò°üò°

"I  bought a new ute but took it back to the dealer the next day because I couldn't get the radio to work.

The technician kindly explained to me that this was a ""SMART UTE"" and the radio was ""VOICE-ACTIVATED"".
He turned the radio on and said, ""Nelson"" to the radio.
The radio replied, ""Ricky or Willy?"" ""Willy"" he continued and 'On the road again' came on the speakers.
Then he said ""AC/DC"", and in an instant, 'Highway to hell' took the place of Willy Nelson.

I drove away happy and for the next few days every time I said ""Pink Floyd"" I would get classic Floyd or if I said ""Beatles"" I would get one of their greatest hits.

Well, yesterday, a fella ran a red light and nearly smashed into my new ute but luckily I swerved in time to avoid it.

I yelled out ""YOU FUCKING IDIOT!""
And the radio said, ""Daniel Andrews or Anthony Albanese?""

I love my new ute!"
