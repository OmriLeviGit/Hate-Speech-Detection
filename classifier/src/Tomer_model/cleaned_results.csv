"NEWS:

I intend to sue Andrew Bolt, Danica De Giorgio & Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust for the defamatory story they ran about me today calling me a ""Jew hater"".

The allegation is baseless and completely untrue. I challenge anyone on this planet to find one example demonstrating I hate Jews. You will never find one!!!

To the contrary, many of my heroes, who share similar views to me, are Jews. Just to name a few, they include:

1. Noam Chomsky
2. Norman Finkelstein
3. Ilan Pappe
4. Oliver Stone
5. Gideon Levy

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

My advice to you is to apologise to me immediately to mitigate the damage you've caused to my reputation.

""If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it,"" he said, ""The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries.""In other words, the way we calculate proportionality is not determined by some a priori moral edict but rather the norms and customs created by militaries as they adopt new and most often more lethal forms of war-making.What is clear is that as Israel decimates Gaza and kills tens of thousands of people, it is also attempting to recreate the norms of war-making and significantly transform interpretations of the laws of armed conflict.If Netanyahu and his government succeed in rendering Israel's version of proportionality acceptable among other state actors, then the laws of armed conflict will end up justifying rather than preventing genocidal violence.

Social media changed that and is a major reason it is a threat: it gives us the opportunity to hear the view of both sides of a conflict, to potentially understand where the other side is coming from, to make up our own mind with more information that otherwise we would be allowed access to. We know the enormous threat this represents to those who control the narrative. The assumption cannot be made that having access to the response of the other side is going to make us all converts to fans of individual x, but we are entitled to know their reasoning and response in order to better understand potential developments.

The Beheaded Babies, the 40 burnt babies, the genital mutilations, the systemic rape were all unsubstantiated or proven false. The Israelis claim the have footage and photos but the latest U.N. investigation made no finding of rape. To be clear, I have never said there was No Rape. It is something I could never say - it would be a nonsense for anyone to make such a definitive statement.Yet the double page story by Chip Le Grand makes no reference to a)my series of tweets about rape over a period of months that make clear I'm referring to systemic rape. The offending tweet is one where I put it would be counter to their mission to spend time on rape because they would jeopardise their mission which was to grab hostages and try to stay alive for long enough to escape. They would have to be pretty dumb to risk it. As it turns out, as I proffered, the latest U.N. investigation found no evidence that would allow them to conclude there had been rape. But Chip Le Grand reports none of this.His story also took umbrage at my comment that we can't know how many Israel deaths were caused by the IDF on Oct 7.  Many independent commentators are now saying precisely that, including Gideon Levy. Even Piers Morgan can't accept the Israelis know for a fact that a considerable number of Israelis were not killed on that day, because of the Hannibal Directive. And the.

"Today marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For three years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russia's illegal and immoral war of aggression.

Australia mourns the loss of life of Ukraine's citizens and defenders, and the generational toll of Russia's brutality.

Australia continues to stand with Ukraine.

We have committed over $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through vital equipment for the battlefield and the training of Ukrainian forces.

Australia has been clear since day one that Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion, will face consequences.

The Australian Government has today imposed further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 70 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 79 entities.

This constitutes Australia's largest sanctions package since February 2022.

The new sanctions target individuals propping up Russia's illegal administrations in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including so-called ""ministers"", judges and prosecutors, and individuals responsible for conflict-related sexual violence and the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.

The sanctions also target persons and entities involved in deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield.

Deepening Russia-North Korea military cooperation is a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security.

Targets in Russia's defence, transport and finance sectors, and those spreading disinformation to undermine Ukraine and governments around the world, have also been sanctioned.

Australia has now imposed a total of more than 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Government has taken decisive action to ensure Australians are not inadvertently fuelling Russia's war economy.

Today we have further tightened trade bans on Russia by prohibiting the supply of commercial drones and components, including the provision of related services.

Once again, Australia calls on Russia to immediately end its war and adhere fully to its obligations under international law, including in relation to the protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.

Working with Ukraine and our partners, Australia supports a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.

October 7 was a false flag or it wasn't but Israel deserved it anyway. There were no rapes or maybe there were but Israeli soldiers rape everyone or they don't but only because they think Arab women are beneath them. The resistance is winning, glory to the intifada and also it's a genocide. The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe.

Having made many visits to the Gaza Strip, to the West Bank and having had several meetings with Israeli leaders of the peace movement and with leaders of Hamas, I have some understanding of anti-Semitism and of anti-Palestinianism.Back in Sydney, I've been disturbed by assumptions that the key prejudice concerns anti-Semitism. The record shows otherwise. In 2015, for example, seminars to discuss death & destruction in Palestine were held by departments of public health, social work/social policy and by the Centre for Peace & Conflict Studies. On each occasion students representing 'Hebrew Studies' arrived in substantial numbers to close down those seminars one of which was to have included an address by a distinguished Palestinian doctor. Physical intimidation by these invading students and their staff was successful.No-one made official complaints. It seemed to be taken for granted that any discussion of the plight of Palestinians must be anti-Semitic. Years earlier, in 2003 I was subject to sustained charges of anti-Semitism over the Sydney Peace Foundations' choice of the brilliant Palestinian educator and politician Dr. Hanan Ashrawi as the Peace Prize recipient for that year. During that controversy I received significant support not only from Premier Bob Carr but also from former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and from the Sydney University Chancellor Dame Leonie Kramer.I'm not suggesting that anti-Semitic expressions on the Sydney campus do not exist, but PLEASE, let's not be overawed by the demands of a hugely powerful lobby at a time when thousands of people in Gaza and in the West Bank have been slaughtered..' #auspol",Positive,Pro user,stalking pressure vc usyd resign yield valuable insight email mark scott user substantial mark underestimate pressure claim certain student feel unsafe campus note oblige apology alleged existence anti semitism sydney having visit gaza strip west bank having meeting israeli leader peace movement leader hamas understanding anti semitism sydney disturb assumption key prejudice concern anti semitism record show example seminar discuss death destruction palestine hold department public health social work social policy centre peace conflict study occasion student represent hebrew study arrive substantial number close seminar include address distinguished palestinian doctor physical intimidation invade student staff official complaint take grant discussion plight palestinians anti semitic year early subject sustained charge anti semitism sydney peace foundation choice brilliant palestinian educator politician dr hanan ashrawi peace prize recipient year controversy receive significant support premier bob carr prime minister gough whitlam sydney university chancellor dame leonie suggest anti semitic expression sydney campus exist let overawe demand hugely powerful lobby time thousand people gaza west bank slaughter

"So my son had his last day of primary school yesterday. I rocked up for the graduation ceremony to learn that there had been issues with kids writing naughty words on their Year 6 shirts. Of the FU kind.

What unfolded because of those hurty words is astounding. It's a long story but essentially one mum got hunted down by the school for saying those words at a private pre-school breakfast, kids detained for 2.5 hours without food and water, interrogated, shouted at and then denied play time at lunch afterwards. They were then stripped of their graduation medals and the teachers refused to do a farewell speech.

I didn't get a call about it but other parents did.

Does that seem a reasonable response to a few kids writing FU [insert school name] on their shirts?

Glazer's gesture is an attempt to have it all. He is a hero of the hard-left now but still gets to keep his privilege. 

But to those of us who aren't Glazer, being Jewish does not mean that at all. It means belonging to an ancient people who founded monotheistic belief and the ethics and human dignity that stems from it. It means living with rich traditions and a sense of mission. It means belonging to a nation of contributors, survivors, outsiders.
