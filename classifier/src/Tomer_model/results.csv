That was @abcnews in October 2023. Since then nothing. 
ABC radio- zero invites
ABC Q&A- I have not been invited back onto the program since May 2021 and not for want of my name being pitched. There has only been 1 other Palestinian guest, @iamthenas, and he has only been invited once despite the fact Gaza has been a topic in multiple episodes. 

This is deliberate, calculated censorship and erasure. There is no question about my qualifications to speak on what is happening, on my scholarly expertise and lived experience. I can run circles around the people on this episode of Insiders for example. 
This is anti-Palestinian racism in its purest form. It is racial segregation by our national broadcaster which platforms Anglo guests to offer their ideologically loaded opinions whilst Palestinian experts are excluded and deliberately ignored. 
That I am not surprised by the ABC's institutional racism (hello @antoinette_news ) is not the point of this tweet. My point is that we will keep on writing the record of the ABC's role as handmaiden to genocide. We will keep on recording this history of racial segregation and the names of the people who make the decisions and the bystanders who chose silence over principled journalism.

heck even Facebook pages (a NSW history teacher page of hundreds) banning discussion of ""the conflict' because of ""different views"", ""distress to employees"", ""inclusivity and respect"". 

Free speech isn't the most important issue at stake.   

Every time an organisation or employer or administrator bans discussion about the ""conflict"" they have declared their moral position: namely, that there are both-sides to genocide. That there are both sides to apartheid. That there are two sides to settler colonialism. That there are two sides to Jewish supremacist ideology. 

This is not about protecting employees from harm. It's about exceptionalising Zionism as an ideology and world view that is owed respectability and accommodation. We do not accommodate or hold space for racism, sexism, homophobia in workplaces. We do not say that espousing anti-racism or displaying anti-homophobia studies is divisive or affects the wellbeing of racists or homophobes. 

If you are a Zionist you should be uncomfortable, you should be embarrassed to spout your Jewish supremacist racism. You should be shamed into discomfort about supporting apartheid and settler colonialism.",Positive,User agreement

After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine's suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive.

"Sent to me by a friend - 

Banking 
Our hopeful future PM, Albo walked into a bank to cash a cheque

When he's called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Albo said, ""Truthfully, I didn't bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I'm the leader of the Labor Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, ""Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they'll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I'm sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albo snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Patrick Rafter came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese, what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Albo stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. 
I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

"Jonathan Glazer spoke the words: we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness. What is curious about this is that had someone refuted their black or Asian identity they would be branded a fool or a turncoat with internalised hatred. But Glazer won applause. This is because to many, being Jewish means belonging to an ultra-privileged, elite white sect of capitalists. It's like being a Freemason or belonging to a gentlemen's club. The whitest of the white elite. 

Glazer's gesture is an attempt to have it all. He is a hero of the hard-left now but still gets to keep his privilege. 

But to those of us who aren't Glazer, being Jewish does not mean that at all. It means belonging to an ancient people who founded monotheistic belief and the ethics and human dignity that stems from it. It means living with rich traditions and a sense of mission. It means belonging to a nation of contributors, survivors, outsiders.

Put on a Star of David necklace. Do not be afraid. You belong to an extraordinary nation. And I urge our Prime Minister and our government to contemplate and reflect on how it has come to this.

"Where are the Greens?
Where are the Aboriginal Activists? 

How come there never seems to be any little sacred animals where turbines are going, acres and acres , no  sacred animals. No Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombat etc,etc.?

Down the South coast in the Illawarra Region, there has not been any Mythical Rainbow Serpents or whatever there was elsewhere that stropped multi million production for years.
Uncanny that, isn't it? 

In Australian Aboriginal culture, several animals hold spiritual significance. Here are some examples:

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

These animals are deeply connected to the ancestral spirits and the Dreaming, which is the Aboriginal cosmological framework explaining the origins of the world and relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. üåøüêæ",Negative,User agreement

"NEWS:

I intend to sue Andrew Bolt, Danica De Giorgio & Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust for the defamatory story they ran about me today calling me a ""Jew hater"".

The allegation is baseless and completely untrue. I challenge anyone on this planet to find one example demonstrating I hate Jews. You will never find one!!!

To the contrary, many of my heroes, who share similar views to me, are Jews. Just to name a few, they include:

1. Noam Chomsky
2. Norman Finkelstein
3. Ilan Pappe
4. Oliver Stone
5. Gideon Levy

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

My advice to you is to apologise to me immediately to mitigate the damage you've caused to my reputation.

That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.

"So my son had his last day of primary school yesterday. I rocked up for the graduation ceremony to learn that there had been issues with kids writing naughty words on their Year 6 shirts. Of the FU kind.

What unfolded because of those hurty words is astounding. It's a long story but essentially one mum got hunted down by the school for saying those words at a private pre-school breakfast, kids detained for 2.5 hours without food and water, interrogated, shouted at and then denied play time at lunch afterwards. They were then stripped of their graduation medals and the teachers refused to do a farewell speech.

I didn't get a call about it but other parents did.

Does that seem a reasonable response to a few kids writing FU [insert school name] on their shirts?

I've emailed the DoE demanding an investigation into why they fucked up my son's last day of primary school. I copied the principal in so I could fuck up her holidays. Sound fair?",Irrelevant,User agreement

The resistance is winning, glory to the intifada and also it's a genocide. The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe.

"****Important article: we live in very dangerous times****Israel Seeks to Rewrite the Laws of War'If the world accepts the way Israel now interprets the principle of proportionality, then genocide will become justified.'By Neve Gordon, Professor of International Law at Queen Mary University of London.'If the world accepts the way Israel now interprets the principle of proportionality, then genocide will become justified.The former head of the department, Colonel Daniel Reisner, also publicly stated this strategy was pursued through ""a revision of international law"". ""If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it,"" he said, ""The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries.""In other words, the way we calculate proportionality is not determined by some a priori moral edict but rather the norms and customs created by militaries as they adopt new and most often more lethal forms of war-making.What is clear is that as Israel decimates Gaza and kills tens of thousands of people, it is also attempting to recreate the norms of war-making and significantly transform interpretations of the laws of armed conflict.If Netanyahu and his government succeed in rendering Israel's version of proportionality acceptable among other state actors, then the laws of armed conflict will end up justifying rather than preventing genocidal violence. Indeed, the very architecture of the entire international legal order is now in the balance.'https://t.co/oFSlWwzE8h",Positive,User agreement

The Beheaded Babies, the 40 burnt babies, the genital mutilations, the systemic rape were all unsubstantiated or proven false. The Israelis claim the have footage and photos but the latest U.N. investigation made no finding of rape. To be clear, I have never said there was No Rape. It is something I could never say - it would be a nonsense for anyone to make such a definitive statement.Yet the double page story by Chip Le Grand makes no reference to a)my series of tweets about rape over a period of months that make clear I'm referring to systemic rape. The offending tweet is one where I put it would be counter to their mission to spend time on rape because they would jeopardise their mission which was to grab hostages and try to stay alive for long enough to escape. They would have to be pretty dumb to risk it. As it turns out, as I proffered, the latest U.N. investigation found no evidence that would allow them to conclude there had been rape. But Chip Le Grand reports none of this.His story also took umbrage at my comment that we can't know how many Israel deaths were caused by the IDF on Oct 7.  Many independent commentators are now saying precisely that, including Gideon Levy. Even Piers Morgan can't accept the Israelis know for a fact that a considerable number of Israelis were not killed on that day, because of the Hannibal Directive. And the.

Israeli soldiers are telling the press that they've been knowingly killing civilians and then falsely categorising them as terrorists afterward. Countless doctors have testified to routinely encountering dead and wounded children who've been shot in the head by Israeli snipers. Israeli media reports have revealed that the IDF is intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure and using AI systems to specifically target suspected Hamas members when they are at home with their families instead of out on the battlefield.The debate is over. The ""human shields"" argument has been completely, thoroughly debunked. If you still deny that this is happening, its because your worldview is so false that it requires you to deny facts and reality. We were fed lies about what happened on 7 October.

"On cancelling aid to UNRWA:In any other circumstances, Australia would insist on not preempting the results of an investigation. The @UNRWA sacked employees and launched an investigation. We don't know if they are guilty of what they're accused of, but UNRWA's immediate action removing the individuals seems to me a desperate effort to preempt & prevent precisely what happened - the cancellation of desperately needed aid. In any other circumstances, Australia would argue the importance of waiting for the results of an investigation.A separate point altogether is the prism through which we view the world: under occupation in WW11, those who collaborated with Resistance fighters, were also heroic. I am not advocating aid workers should be excused for this, but consider Australia pulled all stops out to save Pratt and Wallace from a life in prison to bring them home when as Care Australia aid workers were also secretly on the payroll of a NATO country in a war zone. They were not in the position of Palestinian UNRWA workers, impacted directly by occupation.The Australian govt is very confused about 'occupation' of the Occupied Territories, as if, rather than the cruel apartheid regime Israel has been, the Occupied Territories have been occupied by some sort of benign, civilised democracy.

Jimmy Carter was a person of deep faith and a true humanitarian who dedicated his post-Presidential life to eradicating disease, preventing conflict, tackling poverty and campaigning for human rights.

In all this, his late wife Rosalynn was always his essential partner and his strongest supporter. 

Former President Carter rose from humble beginnings to leave a remarkable legacy. Beyond being elected to the Presidency or being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter's legacy is best measured in lives changed, saved and uplifted. 

People living free from debilitating disease because of the work of The Carter Center. People with a safe home to call their own, thanks to all those he inspired to contribute to Habitat for Humanity. People spared the toll of conflict because of his tireless efforts as a negotiator.

"Today marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For three years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russia's illegal and immoral war of aggression.

Australia mourns the loss of life of Ukraine's citizens and defenders, and the generational toll of Russia's brutality.

Australia continues to stand with Ukraine.

We have committed over $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through vital equipment for the battlefield and the training of Ukrainian forces.

Australia has been clear since day one that Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion, will face consequences.

The Australian Government has today imposed further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 70 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 79 entities.

This constitutes Australia's largest sanctions package since February 2022.

The new sanctions target individuals propping up Russia's illegal administrations in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including so-called ""ministers"", judges and prosecutors, and individuals responsible for conflict-related sexual violence and the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.

The sanctions also target persons and entities involved in deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield.

Deepening Russia-North Korea military cooperation is a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security.

Targets in Russia's defence, transport and finance sectors, and those spreading disinformation to undermine Ukraine and governments around the world, have also been sanctioned.

Australia has now imposed a total of more than 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Government has taken decisive action to ensure Australians are not inadvertently fuelling Russia's war economy.

Today we have further tightened trade bans on Russia by prohibiting the supply of commercial drones and components, including the provision of related services.

Once again, Australia calls on Russia to immediately end its war and adhere fully to its obligations under international law, including in relation to the protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.

Working with Ukraine and our partners, Australia supports a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.

"The stalking and pressure on the VC of USYD to resign has yielded some valuable insights in an email to Mark Scott from @ProfStuartRees. Here is a substantial excerpt:'Dear Mark,I do not underestimate the pressure you would have been under regarding the claim that certain students felt unsafe on campus and I note that you were obliged to make an apology for the alleged existence of anti-Semitism at Sydney. Having made many visits to the Gaza Strip, to the West Bank and having had several meetings with Israeli leaders of the peace movement and with leaders of Hamas, I have some understanding of anti-Semitism and of anti-Palestinianism.Back in Sydney, I've been disturbed by assumptions that the key prejudice concerns anti-Semitism. The record shows otherwise. In 2015, for example, seminars to discuss death & destruction in Palestine were held by departments of public health, social work/social policy and by the Centre for Peace & Conflict Studies. On each occasion students representing 'Hebrew Studies' arrived in substantial numbers to close down those seminars one of which was to have included an address by a distinguished Palestinian doctor. Physical intimidation by these invading students and their staff was successful.No-one made official complaints. It seemed to be taken for granted that any discussion of the plight of Palestinians must be anti-Semitic. Years earlier, in 2003 I was subject to sustained charges of anti-Semitism over the Sydney Peace Foundations' choice of the brilliant Palestinian educator and politician Dr. Hanan Ashrawi as the Peace Prize recipient for that year. During that controversy I received significant support not only from Premier Bob Carr but also from former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and from the Sydney University Chancellor Dame Leonie Kramer.I'm not suggesting that anti-Semitic expressions on the Sydney campus do not exist, but PLEASE, let's not be overawed by the demands of a hugely powerful lobby at a time when thousands of people in Gaza and in the West Bank have been slaughtered..' #auspol",Positive,Pro user

"My friend Bill Shorten has decided not to contest the next election.

In this term, and right through his 17 years in Parliament, he has given it everything, every day. 

Only 21 people have had the extraordinary privilege of serving as Leader of Australia's oldest political party. 

Bill took over in 2013, united the party, re-energised the Caucus and rebuilt Labor into a strong opposition and a genuine alternative government.  

Through his years as leader, no-one worked harder than Bill, no-one brought more energy, enthusiasm, ideas and ambition to advocating for a Labor Government. 

It's a measure of Bill's character that he channelled the disappointment of 2019 into fighting for justice for the victims of Robodebt. 

@billshortenmp has dedicated so much of his career to building and strengthening the NDIS, and he's determined to see it through.

I've asked Bill to remain in Cabinet until he goes because I want him to finish the vital work he is undertaking on the NDIS, to secure the best possible outcome for people with disability, their families and carers.

"The moment the war came to Australia 83 years ago was almost innocuous, with sailors in Darwin Harbour looking up to admire what they mistook for a friendly formation.

By the time the sirens sounded, the bombs were already falling.

Our nation, once so safe in our geographical isolation, felt the full brunt of a relentless enemy.

The attack was led by the same commander who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than 260 aircraft came roaring in, dropping nearly 700 bombs.

Amid the fear and the confusion, our servicemen fired back with whatever they could lay their hands on, even if it was just a revolver.

There was such desperation, suffering and destruction, but what stood tallest was their extraordinary courage.

Thanks to them, Darwin stood.

Over Japan's nearly two-year campaign and 64 air raids, the defenders of our great northern city responded with courage, resilience and resolve.

They withstood an empire.

And they gave the people of our entire continent the hope that would do so much to carry us through the war.
