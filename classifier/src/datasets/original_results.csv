"Israel attacked Iran in three phases.The first phase involved a subphase destroying a radar site in Syria and suppressing ISR in Iraq, that worked. The next subphase involved launching a drone swarm and SEAD missiles at Tehran, from Jordanian airspace. That failed, everything was shot down -- 100% shoot down rate. The second phase repeated this attack, with greater saturation, it also failed, though a AD site (MIM23 Hawk) exploded for unknown reasons, likely malfunction, killing its operators.The third phase was an attack that came from Azerbaijan. This attack involved low-observability cruise missiles. This was the only attack phase that worked, but it seems their target identification failed -- all the buildings were already emptied.Overall, the attack was a complete failure. Iran didn't even use its best air or highest tier air-defense, but its coordination was perfect. At no time did Israeli fighter jets penetrate or even get NEAR Iranian airspace.Israelis are clownishly pretending they destroyed Iranian AD. If that were the case, there wouldn't just be 3 phases, but an infinite number of phases, they would be bombing Iran RIGHT NOW.",Negative,User agreement

That was @abcnews in October 2023. Since then nothing. 
ABC radio- zero invites
ABC Q&A- I have not been invited back onto the program since May 2021 and not for want of my name being pitched. There has only been 1 other Palestinian guest, @iamthenas, and he has only been invited once despite the fact Gaza has been a topic in multiple episodes. 

This is deliberate, calculated censorship and erasure. There is no question about my qualifications to speak on what is happening, on my scholarly expertise and lived experience. I can run circles around the people on this episode of Insiders for example. 
This is anti-Palestinian racism in its purest form. It is racial segregation by our national broadcaster which platforms Anglo guests to offer their ideologically loaded opinions whilst Palestinian experts are excluded and deliberately ignored. 
That I am not surprised by the ABC's institutional racism (hello @antoinette_news ) is not the point of this tweet. My point is that we will keep on writing the record of the ABC's role as handmaiden to genocide.

"Doom & Gloom Goes Poof Begone: 10 Days Of Darkness D. Trump took away CBDC.D. Trump took away WHO. D. Trump is took away FEMA.D. Trump is took away DEI.D. Trump took away Paris Climate Agreement. These were basic requirements for the New World Order. Do you now see how you are moving away from the negative timeline? Timeline Jump Clarification:Now what did the Pentagon announce? That today on January 25th they are going dark for 10 days correct? Why would they choose this day right after Pete Hegseth was confirmed for Secretary of Defense?What is the significance of this planetary parade along with the Crypto Regulation that Senator Lummis is willing to work all weekend for on January 25th into tomorrow? When it comes to timeline jumps although not observable through traditional instruments, it manifests through synchronistic events, collective intuition, and an acceleration of transformative news. Which is why I try to be more literal in that regard based on what can be viewed through certain events that leads you in the right direction. From an esoteric standpoint, planetary alignments or auspicious calendar dates are believed to open cosmic gateways. Are you following me on this? These gateways facilitate a heightened collective awareness one where previously hidden truths or policy shifts suddenly emerge into the spotlight. This sense of ""timing"" is often felt rather than measured: people report sharper intuition, increased coincidences, or the impression that ""something big"" has arrived. The Pentagon going dark for 10 days starting today coupled with an astrological window, to me suggests a period where old security protocols and new covert strategies collide potentially reorienting public or governmental focus. And what had Donald Trump stated before? That he will not allow 'The Enemy' to know beforehand what he will do correct? So what do you think he is preparing for now that Pete Hegseth was confirmed with a 51-50 vote while in California? Did you know the 5150 is a police code in California? You all do know the D. Trump likes to troll right? Did you know 5150 allows for the involuntary detention of an adult experiencing a mental health crisis? Would Karen Bass fit this? (Joke) or is it? A person who is a danger to themselves or others can be placed on a 5150. This can be a metaphor to what is slated to occur. Is this symbolic of certain political figures might be ""in crisis"" or ripe for involuntary removal if found guilty of extreme offenses? What would the Pentagon have to do with that? Do you think a 10-day communications blackout might shield high-level military operations from media leaks, allowing arrests or investigations to proceed in relative secrecy before the public learns details? What Could Be Going On During The 10 Day Blackout? 1. In the first days, the Pentagon restricts external communications and enforces strict clearance protocols. This ensures that potential leaks or countermeasures from those under investigation are minimized.2. Teams are assembled to finalize sealed indictments or evidence packages particularly those tied to high-profile figures.3. During the blackout, specialized military units and federal agencies convene for classified briefings. They map out simultaneous raids, arrests, or public disclosures set to occur the moment the blackout ends.4. Behind the scenes, the Pentagon's IT and intelligence branches reconfigure data management systems. They prioritize sensitive material for immediate, wide release upon reactivation (think: declassified documents, lists, evidence relating to sex trafficking or deep-seated corruption).5. These 10 days allow them to quietly patch vulnerabilities, preventing sabotage by those who might try to destroy digital records or manipulate official archives.This comes after Donald Trump imposed a communications blackout across America's federal health agencies, including the CDC, FDA, HHS, and NIH. These agencies have been instructed to halt all external communications, such as publishing scientific reports, updating websites, and issuing health advisories. Kash Patel Confirmation Next Week? What can happen once officially selected?Jeffrey Epstein List?Well if that is the case I suspect the Pentagon is getting logistics prepared as a result of the declassification during these 10 days.  Does this make sense to you? When major institutions like the Pentagon suddenly break routine, or when lawmakers fast-track legislation, it signals an unfreezing of stagnant energies. In a spiritual sense, any break from the status quo can open cracks through which new realities can take root. If these changes lean toward greater transparency (e.g., clarifying cryptocurrency laws) and push us toward innovative tech (quantum leaps, AI breakthroughs), it suggests a movement toward a more positive, inclusive future. You can not tell me a timeline jump is not about to occur starting today. But before that we must go through the house cleaning.

Today, in honouring Richard Norden and all he fought for, Australia also honours all those who fought for him. 

His fellow veterans, those who served alongside him and those who took up his cause when they learned his story. 

Everyone who kept alive the memory of his valour.

Everyone who has championed and advocated due recognition of Richard Norden.

And everyone who has kept faith with Australia's promise to remember all those who have served and their loved ones.

I know that Jewish Australians who have a long and proud tradition of contribution to Australian football will agree. Foster's legal arguments about the International Court of Justice and the claim of genocide are plainly wrong and his assertions about universal human rights are manipulative and misleading. After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine's suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive. Sport provides momentary respite from life's stresses and horrors and Foster's nonchalant attempt to deny this to Israelis is a low move.",Negative,User agreement

Today I have officially commenced legal proceedings against Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust, Andrew Bolt & Danica De Giorgio. 

For the last 10 months, the criminal regime of Israel has been committing genocide against the Palestinian people. Day by day, Israel massacres little children, right before our eyes - to our eternal shame.

The sleazy, dishonest & unprovoked attack on me by Sky News & its servants, in an attempt to silence me for speaking up against israel's shocking crimes against humanity is unforgivable. I now seek justice for their baseless slander. 

I dedicate my fight to the victims of Israel's genocide. 

I would like to pay homage to my legal team led by the esteemed Mr Phillip Boulten SC, Mr Christopher Parkin & Mr Tarek Kheir (@BirchgroveLegal).

"Sent to me by a friend - 

Banking 
Our hopeful future PM, Albo walked into a bank to cash a cheque

When he's called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Albo said, ""Truthfully, I didn't bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I'm the leader of the Labor Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, ""Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they'll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I'm sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albo snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Patrick Rafter came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese, what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Albo stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. 
I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

"Jonathan Glazer spoke the words: we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness. What is curious about this is that had someone refuted their black or Asian identity they would be branded a fool or a turncoat with internalised hatred. But Glazer won applause. This is because to many, being Jewish means belonging to an ultra-privileged, elite white sect of capitalists. It's like being a Freemason or belonging to a gentlemen's club. The whitest of the white elite. 

Glazer's gesture is an attempt to have it all. He is a hero of the hard-left now but still gets to keep his privilege. 

But to those of us who aren't Glazer, being Jewish does not mean that at all. It means belonging to an ancient people who founded monotheistic belief and the ethics and human dignity that stems from it. It means living with rich traditions and a sense of mission. It means belonging to a nation of contributors, survivors, outsiders.

Students have been told to stay away from campuses. We have been locked down in synagogues. Our security and place in society has been eroded. No more. I urge every Jewish Australian to do something today to deepen their connection to their community and their people. Light Shabbat candles. Put on teffilin. Put on a kippah. Give to charity. Put on a Star of David necklace. Do not be afraid. You belong to an extraordinary nation. And I urge our Prime Minister and our government to contemplate and reflect on how it has come to this.

She funnels insider intel committee briefings on housing and infrastructure to clients like Big Pharma and real estate giants. On March 14, 2023, she met a Pfizer VP at a Georgetown steakhouse, pocketing $250,000 in cash for tipping them on a $1.2 billion NIH grant leak. The townhouse? Bought June 2023, title traced to a shell LLC (""JLC Holdings"") funded by that payoff.Extortion Of Corporate DonorsCrockett's leveraged her House Oversight Committee seat to shake down donors. In November 2023, she threatened a Dallas-based oil exec with a ""public ethics probe"" unless he wired $800,000 to her personal account (routing number ending 8472). The exec complied on December 1, 2023 funds laundered through a Cayman account and funneled into the $1.5 million loft purchase, closed January 2024. Her Oversight grilling of oil CEOs on March 6, 2024, was a front half the room owed her silence money.Trafficking KickbacksCrockett's tied to the D.C. tunnel network. Specifically the Rayburn House Office Building. Since April 2023, she's taken a 10% cut ($1.2 million annually) from trafficking profits, brokered by a House aide (initials T.R.) who moves minors for elite clients. On July 9, 2023, she signed off on a ledger entry  approving $300,000 for a ""consulting fee,"" which funded the $1.5 million lakefront cabin in Michigan, titled under her cousin's name to dodge scrutiny. The cabin's deed, filed August 2023, lists a $50,000 down payment cash from that kickback. Her Fake NGO GriftIn February 2024, Crockett launched a ""civil rights foundation,"" ""Justice for All TX,"" raising $2.5 million from corporate sponsors (e.g., AT&T, $500k) under the guise of voter protection. The funds vanished $1.8 million went to her personal accounts by March 10, 2024, laundered through a Dallas car dealership she part-owns. The rest bought luxury goods Rolex, furs shipped to her loft address, intercepted by a private courier on March 15, 2024.Crockett's $9 million isn't luck or savings it's blood money. Her America First Media gig is a cover; the $174,000 salary's a pittance compared to the $5.5 million in illicit gains since 2023. The properties are trophies of corruption each tied to a dirty deal.

It was the first time Netanyahu did not say ""destroy Hamas,"" but rather ""destroy Hamas's capabilities.""

It is becoming clear that Israel will not erase Hamas from existence. 

As we have noted, all Hamas need do to win is survive. 

If Hamas still exists, then it won the war and the destruction of Gaza notwithstanding.

So if Hamas is still there, Israelis won't move back to their homes in southern Israel, and Hamas will have succeeded in ""liberating"" the land.",Positive,Pro user

After tearing up a motion and throwing the papers at Pauline Hanson, Thorpe will be absent for the rest of the week.

Labor and the Coalition have joined together to suspend Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe from the Senate for the remainder of the sitting week, after she ripped up a motion by Pauline Hanson on the chamber floor and gave senators the middle finger.
Speaking to the motion, leader of government business Penny Wong said ""too often debate in this place is turning to aggression, to hateful and personal attacks, and there have been multiple instances of Senator Thorpe making inappropriate and sometimes abusive comments towards other senators.""

Stupid Andrew Bolt of @SkyNewsAust has tried to cover his arse on his show tonight by trying to justify the blatant lies & defamatory remarks he made about me last night. He cites my previous tweets in his sick attempt to prove i'm a jew-hater (repeating the defamation). The tweets he sights do not even remotely suggest any anti-jewish sentiment. They are attacks upon zionist israelis responsible for the genocide in Palestine and he knows that perfectly well. Even a child will tell you Zionism is not Judaism and Judaism is not Zionism. There are hundreds of thousands of religous jews around the world who are as outraged as I am about the heinous and despicable war crimes being committed by the terrorist state of Israel. Decent Jews all over the world, have likened gaza to the warsaw ghetto and Israel's actions as nazism of our times. Based on the evidence we are seeing out of Gaza, these descriptions are absolutely fair and accurate.

How come there never seems to be any little sacred animals where turbines are going, acres and acres , no  sacred animals. No Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombat etc,etc.?

Down the South coast in the Illawarra Region, there has not been any Mythical Rainbow Serpents or whatever there was elsewhere that stropped multi million production for years.
Uncanny that, isn't it? 

In Australian Aboriginal culture, several animals hold spiritual significance. Here are some examples:

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

These animals are deeply connected to the ancestral spirits and the Dreaming, which is the Aboriginal cosmological framework explaining the origins of the world and relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. üåøüêæ",Negative,User agreement

"NEWS:

I intend to sue Andrew Bolt, Danica De Giorgio & Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust for the defamatory story they ran about me today calling me a ""Jew hater"".

The allegation is baseless and completely untrue. I challenge anyone on this planet to find one example demonstrating I hate Jews. You will never find one!!!

To the contrary, many of my heroes, who share similar views to me, are Jews. Just to name a few, they include:

1. Noam Chomsky
2. Norman Finkelstein
3. Ilan Pappe
4. Oliver Stone
5. Gideon Levy

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

My advice to you is to apologise to me immediately to mitigate the damage you've caused to my reputation.

That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.

From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine and make love to her until dawn.

Two weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.

You all are about to see many celebrities suddenly become ill. Retiring prematurely. Moving to another country. No longer being interested in acting. They are going to be dropped from endorsement deals. They will be let go by sports teams. You will no longer see them at award shows. You will no longer see them featured on songs or commercials. Clothing brands will ditch them. They will be removed from their charity foundations. You will see a lot of things. Because this is it people. This is what you waited for. We fought for this by sharing all the info we could. And our work is paying off. The victims will be vindicated. We will no longer be shunned by society. They will be forced to confront all the things they denied in order to stay in the good graces of people who couldn't care less about ""The Truth"". All the trolls are about to eat crow. Do not pay them any mind at this point. They have nothing to lose. So they will attempt to downplay the significance of this. These are blackpillers who no longer see no value in anything.

The lights that once shone on these figures, illuminating their every move, are now flickering out, one by one, in a spectacle of dramatic dimness. This isn't merely the end of a chapter; it's the apocalyptic conclusion of a saga where fame was both the sword and the shield, now rusted and discarded.As the tide turns, those who once danced in the spotlight will find themselves in shadows, not by choice but by the inexorable force of revelation. Their names, once synonymous with glamour and success, will become whispers of caution, tales told in the dim corners where once their glory was celebrated. The red carpets, once rolled out in their honor, will be retracted, leaving behind only the echo of their steps.This shift is not just a change in the public's affection; it's a seismic cultural realignment. The idols of yesteryear, who seemed untouchable, are now facing the reality of their own human fragility. The public, once their adoring crowd, now becomes their jury, delivering a verdict that resonates with the weight of truth over the dazzle of stardom.In this new dawn, the narratives will rewrite themselves. The stories of courage will not be about overcoming adversity in the spotlight but about facing the aftermath in the cold light of day. Those who once thrived on the applause will learn the silence of solitude, not by choice but by necessity.

Getting a bit agitated, Albanese  snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Andre Agassi came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese , what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Anthony Albanese stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

NC- Federal Response Overruled? What I am hearing at this moment is that North Carolina State Police will start arresting Federal employees who are objective & obstructive to aide coming from outside sources and domestic residents within the affected areas. And for those who may question how are thru able to do this. Well it is called State Sovereignty. Something that is preserved under Common Law. All you have to do is read the 10th Amendment. Which clearly have outlines & bylines as to how assistance is rendered to disaster zones. FEMA is supposed to operate in accordance with the state. Not becoming the central authority that override local authorities on all things considered safe & effective. State Rights do not erode under crisis or disaster scenarios where the federal government can operate with impunity and dictate how assistance is mandated while also hindering those efforts at the same time without that State also having the right to prevent overhead & overreach from imposing and exerting unauthorized authority to the detriment of said areas.FEMA is in a pressure cooker at this time as the world is now realizing they are the sole party preventing aide from reaching the citizens of North Carolina. Now that Elon Musk has posted about how difficult it has become to implement Starlink to help bolster communications to millions of people it will become even more obvious at tomorrow's rally.

This decision was made before the pandemic took full effect.The K-pop group BTS canceled their planned April 2020 concerts in Seoul, South Korea, due to concerns about the growing impact of COVID-19 in the country, making them one of the first major acts to cancel shows due to the virus.Former One Direction member Louis Tomlinson postponed his tour dates in Italy in late February 2020 as the country became one of the first in Europe to experience a significant outbreak of COVID-19.Green Day postponed their planned Asian tour dates in February 2020 due to concerns about COVID-19 as the virus began spreading in that region.

"People listen to me. If you do not think today is massive on a historical scale let me inform you about CrowdStrike. The servers are located in Ukraine. Can you say election interference? This is a Deep State cybersecurity company. People this is a National Security threat. What did D. Trump receive officially yesterday? Now I want you to think about those in the Democratic Party specifically even though both sides of the political isle are compromised let's just say we are being partisan for sh*ts & giggles. Who help set up the biolabs in Ukraine before they even became president? Barrack Obama. Who was found to be money laundering out of Ukraine? Joe Biden. Who was found to be funneling money to Zelensky through the FTX and the trading firm Alameda Research platform and donating to the Democratic Party? Sam Bankmen Freid. Who were the people in congress who were caught money laundering out if Ukraine? Kevin Mccarthy Steve CohenDiana HarshbargerJohn AxneDwight EvansFred UptonEtc. There are many more ofcourse that were named last year. But this is about CrowdStrike.  Do you now know that the bulk data collected on this outage is going to be given directly to Donald Trump? People this reaches the highest level of government. People ask yourself why is this all coming out hours after D. Trump took his nomination at the RNC? Did he tell you on July 10th that the final battle takes place in 7 days right? Now look at all the events that has transpired since you went to sleep.  This is all connected to the NSA.This is all connected to the CIA.This is all connected to the FBI.Now you can understand the magnitude of what happened with the assassination attempt much clearer. Because the Deep State knew that once D. Trump became the nominee he would no longer wait to strike as what he now is doing is officially public knowledge and can bring everything happening behind the scenes into the forefront for public discourse. Because Joe Biden took this privilege away from him 2 years ago. Now does the phrase ""Panic In DC"" make more sense now? I can go on but I have to start on some yard work.

The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe.

"Western, leftist women supporting an Islamic regime of any kind is about as dumb as it gets.

It's easy to do it from Western countries too, where they are actually allowed to exercise freedom and opinions.

But they have absolutely no idea what it's like living in a place where women are considered half the value of a man.

Protesting so aggressively for Islamic take-over is absurd for so many reasons - but it's also such a slap in the face to millions of women around the Islamic world who are beaten to death for not wearing a hijab, who are stoned and murdered, who are viewed as second class citizens.

I cannot wrap my head around the level of stupidity that must be in place for Western women to do these things. Most of them call themselves ""feminists"", but can't even be bothered to speak up for women being raped and murdered because it doesn't align with their narratives and agendas.

"****Important article: we live in very dangerous times****Israel Seeks to Rewrite the Laws of War'If the world accepts the way Israel now interprets the principle of proportionality, then genocide will become justified.'By Neve Gordon, Professor of International Law at Queen Mary University of London.'If the world accepts the way Israel now interprets the principle of proportionality, then genocide will become justified.The former head of the department, Colonel Daniel Reisner, also publicly stated this strategy was pursued through ""a revision of international law"". ""If you do something for long enough, the world will accept it,"" he said, ""The whole of international law is now based on the notion that an act that is forbidden today becomes permissible if executed by enough countries.""In other words, the way we calculate proportionality is not determined by some a priori moral edict but rather the norms and customs created by militaries as they adopt new and most often more lethal forms of war-making.What is clear is that as Israel decimates Gaza and kills tens of thousands of people, it is also attempting to recreate the norms of war-making and significantly transform interpretations of the laws of armed conflict.If Netanyahu and his government succeed in rendering Israel's version of proportionality acceptable among other state actors, then the laws of armed conflict will end up justifying rather than preventing genocidal violence. Indeed, the very architecture of the entire international legal order is now in the balance.'https://t.co/oFSlWwzE8h",Positive,User agreement

The Beheaded Babies, the 40 burnt babies, the genital mutilations, the systemic rape were all unsubstantiated or proven false. The Israelis claim the have footage and photos but the latest U.N. investigation made no finding of rape. To be clear, I have never said there was No Rape. It is something I could never say - it would be a nonsense for anyone to make such a definitive statement.Yet the double page story by Chip Le Grand makes no reference to a)my series of tweets about rape over a period of months that make clear I'm referring to systemic rape. The offending tweet is one where I put it would be counter to their mission to spend time on rape because they would jeopardise their mission which was to grab hostages and try to stay alive for long enough to escape. They would have to be pretty dumb to risk it. As it turns out, as I proffered, the latest U.N. investigation found no evidence that would allow them to conclude there had been rape. But Chip Le Grand reports none of this.His story also took umbrage at my comment that we can't know how many Israel deaths were caused by the IDF on Oct 7.  Many independent commentators are now saying precisely that, including Gideon Levy. Even Piers Morgan can't accept the Israelis know for a fact that a considerable number of Israelis were not killed on that day, because of the Hannibal Directive. And the.

Mr Gillham made his personal remarks without seeking the MSO's approval or sanction. They were an intrusion of personal political views on what should have been a morning focused on a program of works for solo piano.The MSO does not condone the use of our stage as a platform for expressing personal views. Mr Gillham will not be performing in the advertised concert with the MSO this Thursday night at Melbourne Town Hall. Customers will be advised of this change to Thursday's program as soon as possible.The MSO was at no point made aware of the content of the remarks Mr Gillham was intending to make. They were made completely without authority.The MSO understands that his remarks have caused offence and distress and offers a sincere apology. It has been a priority for us to address this difficult situation today.The MSO's values are Respectful, Collaborative, Innovative and Diverse and they are at the heart of what we do and how we act. They guided why we accepted the work to be performed, and why we've acted as a result of the unauthorised statements. Music brings people together and that is why one of our guiding principles is ""We unite our individual strengths and celebrate our unifying love of music, fostering understanding and belonging"".

If we are to have any hope of changing things for the better, we need to have the balls to recognize the truth and call out what is really going on, no matter the cost.Jewish Zionists control the media. They infiltrate our Governments through lobbying organisations such as AIPAC. They run perverted corporations like Disney and Nickelodeon. They finance and promote pornography, corrupting the minds of future generations and weakening the souls of young men. They exercise disproportionate control over our banks and enslave the masses through endless debt. They push degenerate LGBT propaganda, dividing the West and poisoning the very fabric of human nature, that of gender. They brainwash us through Hollywood and the entertainment industry. They drag us into war after war against in the hopes of propping up the state of Israel and weakening Arab states. Through blackmail and child trafficking rings, they ensure no American politician strays too far from the box that has been set up for them. They create and fund race tensions and finance both sides of the culture war. They hate populism, they hate God, and they are atheistic Satanists.The further you look, the harder it is to deny the truth, however uncomfortable that truth may be. I will be called antisemitic. I will be cancelled. I couldn't give a fuck.Of course there is a caveat. Not all Jews are bad people. I've met and spoken with many Jews who oppose Zionism and are doing much good work to expose it.

"Israel is killing civilians in Gaza on purpose, and it's not even debatable - @caitoz 'Just so we're all clear, it is a fully established fact that the IDF is directly, deliberately killing civilians in Gaza. There was a time in the early days of the genocide when this could be disputed, but that is no longer true. The facts are in and the case is closed. It's happening. Israeli soldiers are telling the press that they've been knowingly killing civilians and then falsely categorising them as terrorists afterward. Countless doctors have testified to routinely encountering dead and wounded children who've been shot in the head by Israeli snipers. Israeli media reports have revealed that the IDF is intentionally targeting civilian infrastructure and using AI systems to specifically target suspected Hamas members when they are at home with their families instead of out on the battlefield.The debate is over. The ""human shields"" argument has been completely, thoroughly debunked. If you still deny that this is happening, its because your worldview is so false that it requires you to deny facts and reality. We were fed lies about what happened on 7 October. We were fed lies about the Israeli abuses which led to 7 October. We've been fed lies about what's been done for the last 15 months under the justification of 7 October.

"Today marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For three years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russia's illegal and immoral war of aggression.

Australia mourns the loss of life of Ukraine's citizens and defenders, and the generational toll of Russia's brutality.

Australia continues to stand with Ukraine.

We have committed over $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through vital equipment for the battlefield and the training of Ukrainian forces.

Australia has been clear since day one that Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion, will face consequences.

The Australian Government has today imposed further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 70 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 79 entities.

This constitutes Australia's largest sanctions package since February 2022.

The new sanctions target individuals propping up Russia's illegal administrations in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including so-called ""ministers"", judges and prosecutors, and individuals responsible for conflict-related sexual violence and the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.

The sanctions also target persons and entities involved in deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield.

Deepening Russia-North Korea military cooperation is a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security.

Targets in Russia's defence, transport and finance sectors, and those spreading disinformation to undermine Ukraine and governments around the world, have also been sanctioned.

Australia has now imposed a total of more than 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Government has taken decisive action to ensure Australians are not inadvertently fuelling Russia's war economy.

Today we have further tightened trade bans on Russia by prohibiting the supply of commercial drones and components, including the provision of related services.

Once again, Australia calls on Russia to immediately end its war and adhere fully to its obligations under international law, including in relation to the protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.

Working with Ukraine and our partners, Australia supports a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.

"The moment the war came to Australia 83 years ago was almost innocuous, with sailors in Darwin Harbour looking up to admire what they mistook for a friendly formation.

By the time the sirens sounded, the bombs were already falling.

Our nation, once so safe in our geographical isolation, felt the full brunt of a relentless enemy.

The attack was led by the same commander who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than 260 aircraft came roaring in, dropping nearly 700 bombs.

Amid the fear and the confusion, our servicemen fired back with whatever they could lay their hands on, even if it was just a revolver.

There was such desperation, suffering and destruction, but what stood tallest was their extraordinary courage.

Thanks to them, Darwin stood.

Over Japan's nearly two-year campaign and 64 air raids, the defenders of our great northern city responded with courage, resilience and resolve.

They withstood an empire.

And they gave the people of our entire continent the hope that would do so much to carry us through the war.

After a decorated VFL/AFL career as a player and coach, in 2013, Neale was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. 

Neale's battle against what he calls ""the Beast"" has brought new hope and inspiration into the lives of everyone affected by MND and it has won him the boundless admiration of all Australians.

Neale is a co-founder of FightMND which has raised over $100 million to fund vital research  and has made the ""Big Freeze"" an iconic part of the AFL season.

Neale's extraordinary story is not about what MND has taken from him, it's about all that Neale has given: to our awareness of this disease and to the cause of finding a cure.

Neale is fond of the saying ""When all is said and done, more is said than done."" 

It is hard to think of anyone who has done more than Neale in the service of others.

Because how does one process so much loss? So much grief?

How do I tell my aunty it's ok that she has to leave again... and again...and again...from shelter to shelter while the bombs keep following her.

I know you got used to this shit shelter, but the tent might be a good change. We don't even know if they'll find a tent.  If any of them will be alive tomorrow.

"Paul Walker: Stumbling Into A Plot That Caused His To Unravel (Allegedly) My Speculative Overview No confirmation. No official report.The MotivePaul Walker's death was no accident. It was a targeted elimination orchestrated to silence him due to his unintended entanglement in a web of corruption tied to disaster relief funds and their misuse in Haiti. Walker, through his charity Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), had been providing aid in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. His boots-on-the-ground involvement gave him access to information he wasn't supposed to have: evidence that significant portions of relief funds hundreds of millions of dollars were being siphoned off by a network of NGOs, private contractors, and political operatives. This wasn't just mismanagement; it was a deliberate operation involving human trafficking and money laundering, funneled through shell companies and offshore accounts.Walker had discovered that children orphaned by the earthquake were being exploited not rescued. A specific trafficking pipeline was moving them from Haiti to the Dominican Republic, then to ports in Florida and California, under the guise of adoption programs. These children were being sold to elite circles in the U.S. and Europe, with profits laundered through real estate deals and cryptocurrency exchanges (an early precursor to today's more sophisticated blockchain laundering). Walker's mistake was confiding in a colleague at ROWW about documents he'd obtained financial records and shipping manifests linking a prominent U.S.-based foundation to these activities. He planned to take this evidence to a journalist he trusted, someone outside the Hollywood machine.The motive was clear: Walker had to be stopped before he could expose this operation, which would implicate powerful figures and unravel a multi-billion-dollar racket. His death was a preemptive strike to protect the network's secrecy and profitability.The PlayersThe operation involved a constellation of players across government, private sectors, and criminal enterprises. Here are the key figures and entities, identified.The Foundation Head: A high-profile political figure tied to a major U.S. charitable foundation, known publicly for humanitarian work but privately overseeing the diversion of funds. This individual, a woman with deep ties to Washington D.C., authorized the Haiti relief misdirection. Her initials are H.C. (Ok fine, H. Clinton) She didn't order Walker's death directly but greenlit the ""containment"" of any leaks.The Fixer: A former intelligence operative turned private contractor, codenamed ""Raven."" Male, 6'2"", mid-50s at the time, bald with a distinctive scar on his left forearm from a Gulf War injury. He ran a black-ops team out of a nondescript office in Arlington, Virginia. Raven was the one who received the call to eliminate Walker after intercepted communications flagged his intentions. His team specialized in vehicular sabotage and staged accidents.The Mechanic: A Porsche technician based in Los Angeles, employed by a dealership linked to Rodas' racing business. This man, 38 years old in 2013, with a gambling debt exceeding $200,000, was coerced into tampering with the Carrera GT. He installed a remote-activated throttle override device and weakened the steering column bushings subtle enough to evade initial forensic checks but lethal at high speed. His name was Daniel Ortiz (not publicly reported).The Middleman: Roger Rodas himself, unwittingly or not, was a player. A successful businessman and racer, Rodas had ties to Central American charities that overlapped with drug trafficking routes. His involvement in Walker's charity work made him a convenient vector for the hit kill two birds with one stone. Evidence suggests he was unaware of the car's sabotage until it was too late.The Overseers: A cabal of five financiers three American, one British, one Swiss operating through a Luxembourg-based holding company called ""Elysium Ventures."" They managed the laundering of trafficking profits, using Haitian relief as a front. Their names, pulled from classified ledgers: Robert K. Ellison (U.S.), Margaret T. Holloway (U.K.), Jean-Paul Durand (Switzerland), Thomas W. Carver (U.S.), and David L. Stein (U.S.). These individuals remain untouchable, shielded by layers of legal and diplomatic immunity.The Cover-UpThe cover-up was executed with surgical precision, leveraging both technology and human assets:The Car: The Porsche was sabotaged on November 28, 2013, during a routine service at a private garage owned by Rodas. The throttle override was triggered remotely via a signal from a modified cell tower 1.3 miles from the crash site, operated by a shell company tied to Raven's team. Post-crash, the wreckage was quickly removed by a contracted tow firm (not local police), and key components steering rack, throttle body were swapped before the coroner's investigation. The official report of ""speed as the sole cause"" was drafted by a coroner's assistant bribed with $50,000 in cash, delivered in a gym bag at a Santa Clarita diner on December 2, 2013.The Witnesses: Three bystanders saw the crash.

"MY WEEK AT THE FRONT

I just got back to Kyiv after a short trip to the frontline in Kherson and the Donbas. 

Early in the week I walked through the kill zone in Kherson. Here the Russians have been killing or maiming up to 20 Ukrainian civilians a day with FPV drones - the drones literally just drop grenades on people in the street. The Russians film these atrocities and proudly boast about them on Telegram where they call this horror a ""human safari."" Two days before I went to Kherson the Russians dropped grenades on a bus and killed 5 people. Old Ukrainian grandmothers had their legs and arms torn off by shrapnel. This is the reality of Russia's barbaric and genocidal campaign against Ukraine. 

In Kherson I went within about 250 meters of the river which is a death zone. We were approximately 1000 meters back from Russian positions on the other side of the Dnipro river. Russian artillery strikes against the city were constant and the rumble of the Russian guns filled the air like thunder. At one point some Russian tank rounds landed a few blocks away from us. I walked through street after street of abandoned buildings - it was extremely eerie, like walking through a post-apocalyptic setting. The only sounds were the crunch of shattered glass underfoot and the far off thunder of Russian guns. 

In the Donbas I recorded the direct aftermath of the Dobropillya Massacre. The Russians struck a residential apartment block, an old  five story Khrushchevka building. 14 dead and 50 injured - slaughtered and maimed in their beds while at sleep. I documented the aftermath of the carnage some 36 hours after the massacre took place. 

Tragically I think the ultimate death toll will be much higher. I walked through apartments that were completely incinerated. There was absolutely zero chance of survival near ground zero - the crater from just one of the Iskander ballistic missile hits was almost 10 meters deep. I found shards of glass as big as my arm strewn throughout the children's playground right next to the disaster zone - the force of the explosion would have sent these massive shards of glass flying through the air like bullets. 

To make this war crime even more heinous the Russians carried out a ""double tap"" strike against the first responders with banned cluster munitions. They first perfected this war crime during the Syrian Civil War. I filmed shrapnel indentations in nearby walls, massive chunks of concrete gouged out of buildings for hundreds of meters in all directions. Direct evidence of Russian war crimes. 

I will post all this footage to YouTube and publish my thoughts about what I saw on my Substack. Please consider subscribing to follow this.",Negative,Pro user

"üîä Some words about my up coming article! ‚ö°Ô∏èI suppose it's instructive for me to introduce what I'm about to write so it doesn't look it dropped out of no where.More significantly, why I chose to write it now.Much of what I write in this tweet is a spoiler and is skippable because I will repeat it again in my article, so you can skip this entire thing and not miss out on anything. But if you're curious...We are actually at a precipice as a species and there is precisely no one writing about the specific danger we are facing. Even decision makers do not quite care about this problem. Ancient sages understood it from a spiritual perspective but no one cares about that today. Ted Kaczynski understood part of it in the ""Industrial Society and Its Future"" but I believe he only understood it from an anti-technological/liberal perspective. The writers of Serial Experiments Lain understood it, from a technological and social perspective, but spirit seemed to be left out. To overcome this problem, we have to understand it from every relevant perspective to us. It's necessary to understand the technology, why it was made, what it really does and how it will affect us as a spiritual species.Here is the grand problem, worse than event X, worse than nuclear war, worse than even the demons that we are fighting (who understand this at an intuitive level but not on the scale we do):üîä We are living ourselves to death.I know it sounds stupid but that's the simplest way to put it (and I love writing hyperbolic statements so there is that!). Rest assured, if you take the time to read what I write, you will understand this silly statement, from every possible angle and in the context of modern technology and its consequences.This essay will ultimately be about the social media-AI signularity, but we will explore it from the lens of technology and what brought it about, all the way from the earliest known history and then into the future I shall project.You will understand (on a very high level): Production (dumb Marx), Consumption (genius Baudrillard) and Exchange (baka but hopefully interesting me).More specifically:Fine ancient mass-produced artwork.Sovereign currency.Music boxes, vinyl records.Photography/Renaissance art.Semiconductors/Chip making (it's going to sound weird but it's necessary to understand).Computers.Cameras.AI (on a very high level).""Social"" Media.The Rat Utopia.There's a lot of topics to discuss, a lot of boundaries to cross. This is something I've been planning to write for a decade, but kicked the ball across as more pressing things kept coming to my desk (like meeting deadlines at work and in my studies...).Actually, I planned to write this over the last few days but I sadly got sick so I had to focus on some distraction, I settled on trying out ChatGPT o4 (I bought a pro license for a month even, I thought it was that dramatically good). At first I thought it was a waste of time, but it convinced me that my thesis was true and humanity is in great danger -- not for the reasons most think. It's an even worse scenario than Baudrillard envisioned and... well, let's just say I've just taken a long vacation to reflect on things and write it all down.Well, let me also just say this isn't going to be doom and gloom. I'm going to actually give you some solutions, solutions you already know but solutions none of us ever do. Solutions that can not only save your life but the lives of others around you. Perhaps if close friends of mine read it they can even save my own life*.Boy am I hyping this up! I guess I just hope you'll trust me and read through what I want to express, there are things in here you won't learn anywhere else. So wish me luck, I've got enough data/structure and will start writing (producing). All I ask is for distribution (propagation! haha) and ultimately your consideration (consumption -- f-fine, I'll stop now).I really hope I don't go insane from trying to merge so many different topics together into one serialised text.

"The Cradle:How Israeli forces trapped and killed ravers at the Nova Festival 'new details have emerged showing that Israel's Border Police was deployed at the Nova site before Hamas stumbled on the festival, causing the eruption of a major battle.While some ravers were indeed killed by the Palestinian resistance - whether by intent or in the chaos of battle - the evidence now suggests that the majority of civilian deaths were likely inflicted by Israeli forces themselves. This was due to the overwhelming firepower employed by occupation forces - including from Apache attack helicopters - and because Tel Aviv issued the controversial Hannibal Directive to prevent Hamas from taking Israeli party-goers as captives.' #Gazahttps://t.co/OgQG8LTX43",Positive,User agreement

"Beyonce does not even know how to sit down properly (As a pregnant woman) ü§≠Do you all remember this belly deflation? Some would say that this pregnancy was a publicity to cover up what happened to Cathy White when she was actually pregnant with Jay-Z's child and died a year prior to Beyonce announcing her pregnancy. But again there is a trend of questionable women in Hollywood who some say who are not the gender they are portrayed as. But there appears to be a Science behind how this is done before they are even out the womb. Kabbalah Secrets Revealed:Anonymous Source-These people are transformed in utero. By the eighth week of pregnancy, the genitalia have not been formed yet, so they inject the opposite hormone (a blood test will reveal if there's testosterone presence in the mother's blood) into the womb.The result is that the external part of the body is formed according to the hormone injected. So A boy will be born, with the skeleton of a woman, with a penis, but he'll have to take external testosterone for the rest of his life.Conversely, if estrogen is injected, the boy will be born with a vagina but will not be able to have kids, since they cannot pass through the narrow cavity in the pelvis. Old school transformers, would just chop the testes of a boy or give the mother testosterone from animals in order to change the girl. That is their secret. It happens in nature by accident. Google what is a ""freemartin"". End qoute. Now I see why so many who undergo gender reassignment have such horrendous health issues. They were sold the illusion that once you are fully formed you can alter your gender with no side affects. Not realizing the real Science behind this is to do this procedures while the fetus is still forming in the stomach and not after it was born. Which is why it's hard to tell when you look at certain celebrities in Hollywood. This is where the EGI phenomenon is based on. But I digress. Do you all remember she gave birth at Cedar Sinai Hospital?What did I tell you all regard this Hospital when I mentioned Liz Crokin?Why do you think this is the preferred Hospital for Hollywood elite? Think about the tunnels under this hospital that I spoke about. It connects to other Hospitals and home of celebrities. Cedar Senai has covered up thousands of Hollywierd's ""Suicides"", drug overdoses, physcwards, etc. What do I mean? When Biggie Smalls was shot what hospital did they take him to? Cedar Sinai hospital.Also have you noticed the female EGIs in Hollywood like Pink always give birth in Cedar Sinai Hospital? Olivia Wilde gave birth in Cedar Sinai Hospital when she was living in New York City in 2014.Victoria Beckham gave birth in Cedar Sinai Hospital in 1999 when she was living in Goffs Oak, Hertfordshire, England.Cher gave birth in Cedar Sinai Hospital. Tori Spelling gave birth in Cedar Sinai Hospital. People need to look into this hospital. It has a very dark story to tell. This is the hospital that helps with giving the illusion that some females in Hollywood  are actually women. The same media is trying to convince you that men can get pregnant. The same media is trying to convince you that migrants are legal citizens. The same media is trying to convince you that MAGA are terrorists. The same media trying to convince you that obesity is sexy. The same media trying to convince you that  Joe Biden won 2020.The same media trying to convince you that men in dresses deserve to be in women restrooms.The same media trying to convince you the Drag Queen story hour is normal.

"The stalking and pressure on the VC of USYD to resign has yielded some valuable insights in an email to Mark Scott from @ProfStuartRees. Here is a substantial excerpt:'Dear Mark,I do not underestimate the pressure you would have been under regarding the claim that certain students felt unsafe on campus and I note that you were obliged to make an apology for the alleged existence of anti-Semitism at Sydney. Having made many visits to the Gaza Strip, to the West Bank and having had several meetings with Israeli leaders of the peace movement and with leaders of Hamas, I have some understanding of anti-Semitism and of anti-Palestinianism.Back in Sydney, I've been disturbed by assumptions that the key prejudice concerns anti-Semitism. The record shows otherwise. In 2015, for example, seminars to discuss death & destruction in Palestine were held by departments of public health, social work/social policy and by the Centre for Peace & Conflict Studies. On each occasion students representing 'Hebrew Studies' arrived in substantial numbers to close down those seminars one of which was to have included an address by a distinguished Palestinian doctor. Physical intimidation by these invading students and their staff was successful.No-one made official complaints. It seemed to be taken for granted that any discussion of the plight of Palestinians must be anti-Semitic. Years earlier, in 2003 I was subject to sustained charges of anti-Semitism over the Sydney Peace Foundations' choice of the brilliant Palestinian educator and politician Dr. Hanan Ashrawi as the Peace Prize recipient for that year. During that controversy I received significant support not only from Premier Bob Carr but also from former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and from the Sydney University Chancellor Dame Leonie Kramer.I'm not suggesting that anti-Semitic expressions on the Sydney campus do not exist, but PLEASE, let's not be overawed by the demands of a hugely powerful lobby at a time when thousands of people in Gaza and in the West Bank have been slaughtered..' #auspol",Negative,Pro user
