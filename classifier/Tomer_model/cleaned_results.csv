"REPLY TO BOLT:

Stupid Andrew Bolt of @SkyNewsAust has tried to cover his arse on his show tonight by trying to justify the blatant lies & defamatory remarks he made about me last night. He cites my previous tweets in his sick attempt to prove i'm a jew-hater (repeating the defamation). The tweets he sights do not even remotely suggest any anti-jewish sentiment. They are attacks upon zionist israelis responsible for the genocide in Palestine and he knows that perfectly well. Even a child will tell you Zionism is not Judaism and Judaism is not Zionism. There are hundreds of thousands of religous jews around the world who are as outraged as I am about the heinous and despicable war crimes being committed by the terrorist state of Israel. Decent Jews all over the world, have likened gaza to the warsaw ghetto and Israel's actions as nazism of our times. Based on the evidence we are seeing out of Gaza, these descriptions are absolutely fair and accurate. 

NOW APOLOGISE AND MITIGATE THE DAMAGE YOU'VE CAUSED. HOW DARE YOU SULLY MY GOOD NAME BY MAKING UP DISGUSTING LIES ABOUT ME. #GenocideInPalestine #FreePalestine #auspol

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

Speaking to the motion, leader of government business Penny Wong said ""too often debate in this place is turning to aggression, to hateful and personal attacks, and there have been multiple instances of Senator Thorpe making inappropriate and sometimes abusive comments towards other senators.""

Foster's legal arguments about the International Court of Justice and the claim of genocide are plainly wrong and his assertions about universal human rights are manipulative and misleading. After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine's suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive.

"NEWS:

I intend to sue Andrew Bolt, Danica De Giorgio & Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust for the defamatory story they ran about me today calling me a ""Jew hater"".

The allegation is baseless and completely untrue. I challenge anyone on this planet to find one example demonstrating I hate Jews. You will never find one!!!

To the contrary, many of my heroes, who share similar views to me, are Jews. Just to name a few, they include:

1. Noam Chomsky
2. Norman Finkelstein
3. Ilan Pappe
4. Oliver Stone
5. Gideon Levy

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

My advice to you is to apologise to me immediately to mitigate the damage you've caused to my reputation.

Our nation, once so safe in our geographical isolation, felt the full brunt of a relentless enemy.

The attack was led by the same commander who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than 260 aircraft came roaring in, dropping nearly 700 bombs.

Amid the fear and the confusion, our servicemen fired back with whatever they could lay their hands on, even if it was just a revolver.

There was such desperation, suffering and destruction, but what stood tallest was their extraordinary courage.

Thanks to them, Darwin stood.

Over Japan's nearly two-year campaign and 64 air raids, the defenders of our great northern city responded with courage, resilience and resolve.

They withstood an empire.

And they gave the people of our entire continent the hope that would do so much to carry us through the war.
