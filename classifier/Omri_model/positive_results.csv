Free speech isn't the most important issue at stake.   

Every time an organisation or employer or administrator bans discussion about the ""conflict"" they have declared their moral position: namely, that there are both-sides to genocide. That there are both sides to apartheid. That there are two sides to settler colonialism. That there are two sides to Jewish supremacist ideology. 

This is not about protecting employees from harm. It's about exceptionalising Zionism as an ideology and world view that is owed respectability and accommodation. We do not accommodate or hold space for racism, sexism, homophobia in workplaces. We do not say that espousing anti-racism or displaying anti-homophobia studies is divisive or affects the wellbeing of racists or homophobes.

2. The cessation of Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from there.

Under the current conditions and under the Netanyahu government, these demands will obviously not be met.

Glazer's gesture is an attempt to have it all. He is a hero of the hard-left now but still gets to keep his privilege. 

But to those of us who aren't Glazer, being Jewish does not mean that at all. It means belonging to an ancient people who founded monotheistic belief and the ethics and human dignity that stems from it. It means living with rich traditions and a sense of mission. It means belonging to a nation of contributors, survivors, outsiders.

"‚ö†Ô∏è Be wary of shifting rhetoric.

In a meeting yesterday with local council heads in southern Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made an important shift in addressing the war against Hamas.

""We will not stop until we destroy Hamas's terrorist capabilities."" 

It was the first time Netanyahu did not say ""destroy Hamas,"" but rather ""destroy Hamas's capabilities.""

It is becoming clear that Israel will not erase Hamas from existence. 

As we have noted, all Hamas need do to win is survive. 

If Hamas still exists, then it won the war and the destruction of Gaza notwithstanding.

So if Hamas is still there, Israelis won't move back to their homes in southern Israel, and Hamas will have succeeded in ""liberating"" the land."

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

My advice to you is to apologise to me immediately to mitigate the damage you've caused to my reputation.

You'll be receiving a Letter of Demand from my lawyers shortly.

In the meantime, #FreePalestine

@SHildebrand88 @NourNaim88 Maybe that's because Israel has banned foreign journalists so people are trying to document the war crimes they are experiencing. Is really not that hard to fathom if you are able to have critical thinking outside of the Israeli propaganda machine.

ICJ was pretty clear about the illegal settlements in occupied Palestine. They never spoke about the cessation of an ""expansion"" of settlements, Penny. Incase you can't read, they basically said: the entire existence of israel on Palestinian land is ILLEGAL. 

The judgement was very clear about others involvement from here on in and it's as simple as: Cancel all weapon contracts with israel, kick the ambassador out and sanction israel until they comply! ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

"This really is beautiful and I thank dear Clementine for posting it. It is the most eloquent and succinct exposition of the anti-Israel movement I've ever seen. Hamas executed six hostages point blank as IDF was closing in. Israel did it. Why would they execute the people they're coming to rescue? Why would they rescue hostages in other bold raids but execute these ones? Why is Clem denying something that Hamas isn't? Don't know. Who even cares. Let's ignore everything and make up whatever suits us. 

October 7 was a false flag or it wasn't but Israel deserved it anyway. There were no rapes or maybe there were but Israeli soldiers rape everyone or they don't but only because they think Arab women are beneath them. The resistance is winning, glory to the intifada and also it's a genocide. The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe. Ok maybe Jews do come from Israel but today's Jews aren't really Jews anyway. 

You wonder why rational arguments, empathy and willingness to compromise doesn't convince these people? It's because you're dealing with cretins and psychopaths."
