That was @abcnews in October 2023. Since then nothing. 
ABC radio- zero invites
ABC Q&A- I have not been invited back onto the program since May 2021 and not for want of my name being pitched. There has only been 1 other Palestinian guest, @iamthenas, and he has only been invited once despite the fact Gaza has been a topic in multiple episodes. 

This is deliberate, calculated censorship and erasure. There is no question about my qualifications to speak on what is happening, on my scholarly expertise and lived experience. I can run circles around the people on this episode of Insiders for example. 
This is anti-Palestinian racism in its purest form. It is racial segregation by our national broadcaster which platforms Anglo guests to offer their ideologically loaded opinions whilst Palestinian experts are excluded and deliberately ignored. 
That I am not surprised by the ABC's institutional racism (hello @antoinette_news ) is not the point of this tweet. My point is that we will keep on writing the record of the ABC's role as handmaiden to genocide. We will keep on recording this history of racial segregation and the names of the people who make the decisions and the bystanders who chose silence over principled journalism.

That there are both sides to apartheid. That there are two sides to settler colonialism. That there are two sides to Jewish supremacist ideology. 

This is not about protecting employees from harm. It's about exceptionalising Zionism as an ideology and world view that is owed respectability and accommodation. We do not accommodate or hold space for racism, sexism, homophobia in workplaces. We do not say that espousing anti-racism or displaying anti-homophobia studies is divisive or affects the wellbeing of racists or homophobes.

"As a lifelong lover of the beautiful game who grew up watching @Craig_Foster's esteemed predecessors, Les Murray and Johnny Warren, I find Foster's campaign to have Israel suspended from FIFA extremely disappointing. I know that Jewish Australians who have a long and proud tradition of contribution to Australian football will agree. Foster's legal arguments about the International Court of Justice and the claim of genocide are plainly wrong and his assertions about universal human rights are manipulative and misleading. After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine's suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive. Sport provides momentary respite from life's stresses and horrors and Foster's nonchalant attempt to deny this to Israelis is a low move.",Negative

Today I have officially commenced legal proceedings against Murdoch's @SkyNewsAust, Andrew Bolt & Danica De Giorgio. 

For the last 10 months, the criminal regime of Israel has been committing genocide against the Palestinian people. Day by day, Israel massacres little children, right before our eyes - to our eternal shame.

The sleazy, dishonest & unprovoked attack on me by Sky News & its servants, in an attempt to silence me for speaking up against israel's shocking crimes against humanity is unforgivable. I now seek justice for their baseless slander. 

I dedicate my fight to the victims of Israel's genocide. 

I would like to pay homage to my legal team led by the esteemed Mr Phillip Boulten SC, Mr Christopher Parkin & Mr Tarek Kheir (@BirchgroveLegal).

Now that the matter is before the courts, I'll do the rest of my talking when the hearing commences.

The firebombing of a synagogue in Melbourne early this morning has brought our community to new depths of sorrow. It is also an entirely predictable development. For over a year we have seen racist mobs impeding on the rights and freedoms of ordinary Australians. We have been locked out of parts of our cities because the police could not ensure our safety. Students have been told to stay away from campuses. We have been locked down in synagogues. Our security and place in society has been eroded. No more. I urge every Jewish Australian to do something today to deepen their connection to their community and their people. Light Shabbat candles. Put on teffilin. Put on a kippah. Give to charity.

It is becoming clear that Israel will not erase Hamas from existence. 

As we have noted, all Hamas need do to win is survive. 

If Hamas still exists, then it won the war and the destruction of Gaza notwithstanding.

So if Hamas is still there, Israelis won't move back to their homes in southern Israel, and Hamas will have succeeded in ""liberating"" the land.",Positive

How come there never seems to be any little sacred animals where turbines are going, acres and acres , no  sacred animals. No Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombat etc,etc.?

Down the South coast in the Illawarra Region, there has not been any Mythical Rainbow Serpents or whatever there was elsewhere that stropped multi million production for years.
Uncanny that, isn't it? 

In Australian Aboriginal culture, several animals hold spiritual significance. Here are some examples:

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

These animals are deeply connected to the ancestral spirits and the Dreaming, which is the Aboriginal cosmological framework explaining the origins of the world and relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. üåøüêæ",Negative

"Today marks three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For three years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russia's illegal and immoral war of aggression.

Australia mourns the loss of life of Ukraine's citizens and defenders, and the generational toll of Russia's brutality.

Australia continues to stand with Ukraine.

We have committed over $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through vital equipment for the battlefield and the training of Ukrainian forces.

Australia has been clear since day one that Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion, will face consequences.

The Australian Government has today imposed further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 70 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 79 entities.

This constitutes Australia's largest sanctions package since February 2022.

The new sanctions target individuals propping up Russia's illegal administrations in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including so-called ""ministers"", judges and prosecutors, and individuals responsible for conflict-related sexual violence and the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.

The sanctions also target persons and entities involved in deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield.

Deepening Russia-North Korea military cooperation is a dangerous expansion of Russia's war, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security.

Targets in Russia's defence, transport and finance sectors, and those spreading disinformation to undermine Ukraine and governments around the world, have also been sanctioned.

Australia has now imposed a total of more than 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Government has taken decisive action to ensure Australians are not inadvertently fuelling Russia's war economy.

Today we have further tightened trade bans on Russia by prohibiting the supply of commercial drones and components, including the provision of related services.

Once again, Australia calls on Russia to immediately end its war and adhere fully to its obligations under international law, including in relation to the protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.

Working with Ukraine and our partners, Australia supports a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.

The allegation is baseless and completely untrue. I challenge anyone on this planet to find one example demonstrating I hate Jews. You will never find one!!!

To the contrary, many of my heroes, who share similar views to me, are Jews. Just to name a few, they include:

1. Noam Chomsky
2. Norman Finkelstein
3. Ilan Pappe
4. Oliver Stone
5. Gideon Levy

If you look at my track-record, I don't take injustice lightly. I have always vigorously and successfully stood up for my rights through the appropriate channels.

No doubt, there are people working in the shadows who are behind this false story - trying their best to discredit me simply for raising awareness of the genocide taking place in Palestine - being perpetrated by the criminal state of Israel.

To those people & insidious group/s planning and plotting against me - I will not be silenced. As long as my heart beats, I will be taking issue with Israel's 75 years of heinous OPPRESSION, OCCUPATION AND MASS MURDER of the Palestinian people.

For over 3 months now, we've witnessed right before our eyes, a horrific genocide being committed by Israel against defenceless Palestinians which has seen over 30,000 civilians, including babies and children, slaughtered in cold blood.

I, like the majority of people on this earth, have been completely horrified by the unprecedented evil, savagery and barbarity of Israel's war crimes.

If Bolt or Sky News had a shred of decency about them, they would be leading the way in trying to bring the criminal state of Israel to justice. Instead they attack and defame those doing the job the world expects of them.

Andrew Bolt & Sky News - your reputations precedes you for the trashy, sleazy, gutter 'journalism' you dish out of your sewer offices daily.  To the point, you bring the whole profession of journalism into disrepute.

"A young Sydney woman was so depressed that she decided to end her life by throwing herself into the harbour.

Just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her.
""You have so much to live for,"" said the man.
""I'm a sailor, and we are off to Italy tomorrow. I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take care of you, bring you food every day and keep you happy.""

With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to Italy , the woman accepted.

That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.

From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine and make love to her until dawn.

Two weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.
""What are you doing here?"" asked the captain.
""I have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""He brings me food and I get a free trip to Italy .""

Syria, Lebanon, Iraq were created in the same process. An Arab state in Palestine was created in the form of Transjordan (later Jordan) in 1921.

We support the Government's call for a thorough and transparent investigation to determine how this happened and ensure it doesn't happen again.

Casualties caused by accidental fire are a grim reality of war especially one involving a ruthless terrorist force that uses unlawful and sinister tactics intended to ensnare the civilian population in the fighting and inflict maximum suffering on non-combatants. We have seen 3 hostages and dozens of soldiers killed by friendly fire and this is another tragic example.

"Anthony Albanese walked into a bank to cash a cheque
When he's called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Anthony Albanese said, ""Truthfully, I didn't bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I'm the Pwime Minista & leader of the Labour Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, ""Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they'll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I'm sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albanese  snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Andre Agassi came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese , what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Anthony Albanese stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

I didn't get a call about it but other parents did.

Why would they rescue hostages in other bold raids but execute these ones? Why is Clem denying something that Hamas isn't? Don't know. Who even cares. Let's ignore everything and make up whatever suits us. 

October 7 was a false flag or it wasn't but Israel deserved it anyway. There were no rapes or maybe there were but Israeli soldiers rape everyone or they don't but only because they think Arab women are beneath them. The resistance is winning, glory to the intifada and also it's a genocide. The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe.

"With Tropical Cyclone Alfred bearing down on the east coast, we are taking action to help communities prepare.

The Australian Defence Force is ready to assist with personnel and vehicles and we've delivered additional sandbags this morning. 

This is an incredibly stressful time for these communities, but they are taking sensible steps to look after themselves and each other.

At the Queensland Disaster Coordination Centre, together with Premier David Crisafulli, I was briefed on preparations and heard directly from emergency service workers about what communities need.

This is a serious weather event, with heavy rain, destructive winds, and major flooding expected.

To everyone in the warning zone, please stay informed, follow advice from emergency services, and take the necessary precautions to keep yourself and your family safe.

"This is a shocking incident but also deeply revealing. The woman gave no coherent answer to why she refused service to a visibly Jewish man, what was objectionable about the Australian Jewish News or the specific article she was asked to laminate. It was simply, ""I'm pro-Palestine."" Pro-Palestine has become, owing to the individuals and organisations that have come to signify that term, a pathological, irrational hatred for any Jew or any individual who does not share their view that Israel must be bombed or boycotted into nothingness. It leads people to deny or celebrate mass rape, slaughter and abduction. To jettison mantras like ""believe all women."" To revel in the fire bombing of the electorate office of a Jewish MP, to don a mock Hamas headband, daub war memorials with the symbols of terrorist organisations and to feel disgust when in the company of an ordinary Jewish Australian, and still feel righteous, even superior.
