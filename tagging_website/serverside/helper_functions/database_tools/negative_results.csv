"I'm an ARC Future Fellow in Sociology, multi-award winning author of 14 books, former lawyer, an Australian Muslim Palestinian Egyptian intimately connected with grassroots community- and yet in the past 7 months I have had a mere 1 invitation for an interview across all platforms of our national broadcaster. That was @abcnews in October 2023. Since then nothing. 
ABC radio- zero invites
ABC Q&A- I have not been invited back onto the program since May 2021 and not for want of my name being pitched. There has only been 1 other Palestinian guest, @iamthenas, and he has only been invited once despite the fact Gaza has been a topic in multiple episodes. 

This is deliberate, calculated censorship and erasure. There is no question about my qualifications to speak on what is happening, on my scholarly expertise and lived experience. I can run circles around the people on this episode of Insiders for example. 
This is anti-Palestinian racism in its purest form. It is racial segregation by our national broadcaster which platforms Anglo guests to offer their ideologically loaded opinions whilst Palestinian experts are excluded and deliberately ignored. 
That I am not surprised by the ABC's institutional racism (hello @antoinette_news ) is not the point of this tweet. My point is that we will keep on writing the record of the ABC's role as handmaiden to genocide. We will keep on recording this history of racial segregation and the names of the people who make the decisions and the bystanders who chose silence over principled journalism. 
So ABC, are you brave enough to invite me?"

I know that Jewish Australians who have a long and proud tradition of contribution to Australian football will agree. Foster's legal arguments about the International Court of Justice and the claim of genocide are plainly wrong and his assertions about universal human rights are manipulative and misleading. After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine's suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive. Sport provides momentary respite from life's stresses and horrors and Foster's nonchalant attempt to deny this to Israelis is a low move."

"Sent to me by a friend - 

Banking 
Our hopeful future PM, Albo walked into a bank to cash a cheque

When he's called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

Albo said, ""Truthfully, I didn't bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I'm the leader of the Labor Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, ""Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they'll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I'm sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albo snapped, ""C'mon woman, I'm urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Patrick Rafter came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese, what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Albo stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there's nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. 
I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

The firebombing of a synagogue in Melbourne early this morning has brought our community to new depths of sorrow. It is also an entirely predictable development.

Students have been told to stay away from campuses. We have been locked down in synagogues. Our security and place in society has been eroded. No more. I urge every Jewish Australian to do something today to deepen their connection to their community and their people. Light Shabbat candles. Put on teffilin. Put on a kippah. Give to charity. Put on a Star of David necklace. Do not be afraid. You belong to an extraordinary nation. And I urge our Prime Minister and our government to contemplate and reflect on how it has come to this. How under their leadership a house of prayer has been burned. How decent Australians now question whether they have a place in this country. We have been led into a period of darkness. It is time to bring the light and clarity to guide us out.

"Where are the Greens?
Where are the Aboriginal Activists? 

How come there never seems to be any little sacred animals where turbines are going, acres and acres , no  sacred animals. No Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombat etc,etc.?

Down the South coast in the Illawarra Region, there has not been any Mythical Rainbow Serpents or whatever there was elsewhere that stropped multi million production for years.
Uncanny that, isn't it? 

In Australian Aboriginal culture, several animals hold spiritual significance. Here are some examples:

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

These animals are deeply connected to the ancestral spirits and the Dreaming, which is the Aboriginal cosmological framework explaining the origins of the world and relationships between humans, animals, and the environment. üåøüêæ"

"Contrary to contemporary propaganda, the Balfour Declaration didn't give Palestine to the Jews. It didn't give anything to anyone. It favoured the idea of a liberated Ottoman colony which had been held by various foreign empires for 2,000 years, becoming an independent Jewish state at the same time as new Arab states were being created in other territories previously held by the defeated Ottomans. Syria, Lebanon, Iraq were created in the same process. An Arab state in Palestine was created in the form of Transjordan (later Jordan) in 1921. 

A second Arab state in Palestine was offered in 1937 and duly rejected because it would have also meant a Jewish state existing on just 4% of historic Palestine. 

The Palestinians and their supporters can blame Lord Balfour or they can look in the mirror."
"Sinwar planned the October 7 atrocities to ignite pan-Arab pride, unify the Islamic world in armed conflict against Israel and leave it crippled, politically, economically and militarily.

Israel on the other hand is not only in tact but enjoys a greater advantage over its enemies than at any point in its history. Peace with Egypt, Jordan and the Abraham Accord states holds. The US alliance holds. The Palestinian movement in the West has been exposed as a regressive, anti-western malignancy. Iran is isolated except for its band of pantomime pirates in Yemen.

Casualties caused by accidental fire are a grim reality of war especially one involving a ruthless terrorist force that uses unlawful and sinister tactics intended to ensnare the civilian population in the fighting and inflict maximum suffering on non-combatants.

The Yemeni üáæüá™ Navy began mining the waters in the Red Sea. 

After the US and a coalition of 9 other states announced the imminent start of a military operation against Yemen, Houthis began to mine their waters.

Something real big is about to go down."
"Devastated that my friend @joshburnsmp, one of the finest and most decent people I know, had to face this at work this morning. Zionism is the idea that the Jews are a people bound by their history, their culture and traditions and have a right, like all peoples, to choose to live in peace in their own homeland. Josh is proudly Jewish and this is why he was targeted. 

There is a rising current of fascism in this country and a dangerous alliance between the most radical, hateful and violent groups in our society. They have unified around a common hatred of Jews. 

This vile antisemitic act is a challenge to our democracy, our human rights and the right of Jewish Australians to live their lives free from intimidation. Sending my love and solidarity to Josh and his team."
"My message to @SenatorWong 

Instead of preaching to #Israel about how they should protect their citizens;  how about standing up & actually protecting Australian Jewish citizens against the rising tide of #antisemitism

"The US did not ""bomb a country,"" they carried out air strikes on the military infrastructure of an unrecognised terror group. Launching missiles at civilian cargo ships in INTERNATIONAL WATERS is a war crime. 

Mia Khalifa is truly a stupid person."
"Is America ready to discuss this? Or is it still ""racist"" to converse issues like adults?

H/T @1776General_"
@QudsNen OMG this is what the Nazis did.
"Our new laws close dangerous regulatory gaps left by the Liberals in our anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime. 

Tonight Dutton, Cash and the Liberals let Australians down."
"In Australia there is now ""the Muslim Vote""

Does that mean we should also have

""The Christian Vote""

""The Buddhist Vote""

""The Hindu Vote""

""The Sikh Vote""

""The Jewish Vote""

Or should the @AustralianLabor stop pandering & start focusing on what's best for all Australians ?"
Viva Nicaragua viva! @AustralianLabor Govt are you ready... #Endcomplicity in genocide or 'Australia' could be next.
"Can we collectively acknowledge how f*cked it is that, in Western countries, ""cultural differences"" has become a legal defense for rape and sexual assault?

This enrages me beyond words.

@ThePublicaNow"
The ICC can sign the warrants written by the Iranian regime. Newspaper editors can run the demented cartoons of propagandists. Western politicians can betray their allies and ideals. It won't change Israel's right to destroy the terrorists that invaded it and to fight for every innocent soul still held by those butchers.
"Time to defund the ABC ?

If @abcnews journalists can't accept Hezbollah is a proscribed terrorist organisation by the @ausgov; then perhaps it's time taxpayers stopped funding the ABC
