It's easy to do it from Western countries too, where they are actually allowed to exercise freedom and opinions.

But they have absolutely no idea what it's like living in a place where women are considered half the value of a man.

Protesting so aggressively for Islamic take-over is absurd for so many reasons - but it's also such a slap in the face to millions of women around the Islamic world who are beaten to death for not wearing a hijab, who are stoned and murdered, who are viewed as second class citizens.

I cannot wrap my head around the level of stupidity that must be in place for Western women to do these things. Most of them call themselves ""feminists"", but can't even be bothered to speak up for women being raped and murdered because it doesn't align with their narratives and agendas.

—He is the person that blamed Australians for the reason the Voice to Parliament failed, rather than the flawed proposal itself.

—He is the person that is willing to sacrifice native forests and farming land to build solar and wind farms, together with their transmission lines in order to achieve Net Zero emissions. 

—He is the person that blames the Reserve Bank and foriegn countries for the crippling interest rates rather than taking responsibility. 

—He is the person that purchases a multi million dollar mansion, whilst families are losing their homes and can't afford to rent.

—He is the person that has tried to divide Australians by race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation and politics. 

—He is the person that promised Australians cheaper electricity, but increased electricity costs to the most expensive in the world.

—He is the person that tried to silence opposing views online via the disinformation and misinformation bill.

—He is the person that believes importing new Labor voters at a rate of over 500,0000 a year from countries that hold different values than the Australian values is easier than trying to win your vote.

There are those that will seek to regulate and control your freedom of movement, speech and thought. 
This is born out of fear of what individual freedoms may do to their relevance. 
The more freedoms people have the less they rely on their Government. 

Then there are those that recognise the importance of individual freedoms, and believe that a prosperous, healthy and sustainable society is reliant upon those individual freedoms and not Government intervention and draconian regulations that only stifles creativity and an individuals ability to become self-reliant.

The Muslim Vote has partnered with extremist group Hizb ut-­Tahrir and mainstream Islamic bodies to uphold two sacked Bankstown nurses who claimed to have killed Israeli patients as ­victims of “manufactured outrage” in a campaign to silence Palestinian voices.
While the NSW government criticised the “divisive and un­welcome” comments contained in a joint communique, and the ­federal ­opposition chastised mainstream bodies for aligning with known radicals, neither Anthony Albanese nor Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke responded to questions about the statement ­supporting the healthcare ­workers.
The unlikely alliance – which included pro-Palestine independent candidates, and hardline ­Islamic centres and radical preachers – comes after footage of NSW Health nurses Ahmad ­“Rashad” Nadir and Sarah Abu Lebdeh vowing to “kill” Israeli ­patients led to their immediate ­dismissals and sparked an investigation by a state police anti-­Semitism taskforce. 
The communique was put ­together by “Stand 4 Palestine” – a group established and largely run by Hizb ut-Tahrir operatives.
It criticised what it called “co-ordinated outrage” and claimed the response to the two nurses’ comments was “manufactured” to serve a “political narrative”.
“The most revealing aspect of the reaction to the nurses’ video is not the (footage) itself – but the speed, intensity and uniformity of response from certain political leaders and media outlets,” said the statement, endorsed by more than 50 bodies or leaders.
The intervention puts into sharp focus the tightrope authorities must tread as they seek to balance faith in the health system with the anger of parts of the Muslim community over apparent double standards in the governments’ response to anti-Semitism.","2025-02-17T10:21:30.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gj-4FbEbMAAPJb2.jpg""]","https://x.com/RositaDaz48/status/1891432781806243993","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,424,868,2905,40649,,,38820,"‘ONE COUNTRY—ONE FLAG’ 🇦🇺",95022,"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1469597747095343106/X4ZP4ClW_normal.jpg",8912,false,67,92,"{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null}",,,,"2025-03-15T18:49:01.768Z","{""url"":""https://twitter.com/1469597269204762626/status/1891432781806243993""}","{""url"":""https://x.com/RositaDaz48"",""start_date"":""2023-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"",""end_date"":""""}",,,,

In a serious escalation in the crime crisis that has long gripped the Northern Territory, police have also charged a man with breaking into a woman’s home and raping her while she slept, ­despite the man being on a good behaviour bond at the time.
In another incident, police ­arrested two teenage boys for ­aggravated robbery on Thursday after they allegedly demanded ­alcohol from a 57-year-old man at his home, threatening him with a baseball bat and a tomahawk. One allegedly breached a suspended sentence in doing so, and the other was charged last month for exposing himself to a midwife.

Mr Penman is the latest in a growing list of business owners including multiple hospitality heavyweights to publicly ban Andrews.
The franchise king told Daily Mail Australia he had cancelled Andrews and 'believes all of Victoria' should blacklist the former pollie too.
'If I was on the tools, I wouldn't work for him, and I'd encourage any franchisee or independent contractor to do the same,' Mr Penman said.

Labor and the Coalition have joined together to suspend Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe from the Senate for the remainder of the sitting week, after she ripped up a motion by Pauline Hanson on the chamber floor and gave senators the middle finger.
Speaking to the motion, leader of government business Penny Wong said ""too often debate in this place is turning to aggression, to hateful and personal attacks, and there have been multiple instances of Senator Thorpe making inappropriate and sometimes abusive comments towards other senators.""

Where are the Aboriginal Activists? 

How come there never seems to be any little sacred animals where turbines are going, acres and acres , no  sacred animals. No Kangaroos, Koalas, Wombat etc,etc.?

Down the South coast in the Illawarra Region, there has not been any Mythical Rainbow Serpents or whatever there was elsewhere that stropped multi million production for years.
Uncanny that, isn't it? 

In Australian Aboriginal culture, several animals hold spiritual significance. Here are some examples:

Kangaroo: Representing strength, agility, and balance, the kangaroo teaches adaptability and overcoming obstacles1.

Emu: Symbolizing resilience and endurance, the emu inspires perseverance1.

Koalas symbolize wisdom, intuition, and guardianship of knowledge.

They are associated with resilience and harmonious coexistence with nature.

Some stories attribute koalas with power over rain and the ability to cause drought if disrespected.

For many Aboriginals, hunting and eating koalas were forbidden due to their spiritual importance

Wombat: Considered a symbol of wisdom and intuition, the wombat holds special meaning1.

Crocodile: Revered for its power and tenacity, the crocodile embodies strength1.

A woman arrived in a store wearing clothes that showed her body all too well. The shop owner, being a wise older man, took a good look at her, asked her to sit down, looked straight into her eyes, and said something she would never forget for the rest of her life.
“Young Lady, everything that God has made valuable in this world, is covered up and hard to see or find.""
For example:
1. Where can you find diamonds?
• In the ground, covered and protected.
2. Where are the pearls?
• Deep in the ocean, covered and protected in a beautiful shell.
3. Where can you find gold?
• Underground, covered with layers of rock, and to get there you have to work very hard and dig deep.
He looked at her again and said, ""Your body is sacred and unique to God.""
You are far more precious than gold, diamonds, and pearls, therefore you must be covered too.
He then added: ""If you keep your precious minerals like gold, diamonds, and pearls deeply covered, a “reputable mining organization” with the necessary machines, will work for years to mine those precious goods.
* First, they will contact your government (family),
* Second, sign professional contracts (marriage),
* Third, they will professionally extract those goods, and tenderly refine those precious goods. (marital life).
But if you let your minerals find themselves on top of the Earth's surface (exposed to everyone), you will always attract many illegal miners to come, exploit, illegally, and freely take those riches and leave you without the precious goods God gave you!

WOMEN, YOU ARE VALUABLE!! ❤
Remember - Class is more desirable than Trash.

Banking 
Our hopeful future PM, Albo walked into a bank to cash a cheque

When he’s called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Albo said, ""Truthfully, I didn’t bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I’m the leader of the Labor Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, “Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they’ll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I’m sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albo snapped, “C'mon woman, I’m urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Patrick Rafter came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese, what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Albo stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there’s nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. 
I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

With a big smile, the teller said, ""Will that be large or small notes, Mr Albanese?","2024-04-30T06:04:11.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GMZDXh3aMAARQZz.jpg""]","https://x.com/RositaDaz48/status/1785188379967336596","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,288,565,2691,110442,,,38819,"‘ONE COUNTRY—ONE FLAG’ 🇦🇺",95022,"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1469597747095343106/X4ZP4ClW_normal.jpg",8913,false,56,101,"{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null}",,,,"2025-03-15T18:49:18.723Z","{""url"":""https://twitter.com/1469597269204762626/status/1785188379967336596""}","{""url"":""https://x.com/RositaDaz48"",""start_date"":""2023-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"",""end_date"":""""}",,,,

I’m most probably going to offend some friends here.  

So if you don’t know me well enough, go ahead and unfriend me.

I celebrate Australia 🇦🇺 Day because I’m celebrating who we are as Australians.  

-How amazing this Country is.  Nobody “owns” Australia.  

We are all just tenants of it.  

No matter how long anyone has been here.  
-Nobody owns it.  But it’s our home.   
And that’s why I celebrate Australia Day.  🇦🇺
Because it’s my home and every Australian who lives here is my neighbour.  
They are all just tenants like me.  
All our arguments are because someone thinks they have ownership.  
Nobody has ownership of land that was created before any person existed.  
We are all just caretakers of the land we choose to live.  
Respect your fellow neighbours and live, celebrate your part of the world that you call home wherever it is.  Celebrate it every day.

And sorry…. For the misinformed minorities that obviously have some confusion with the date of Australia Day and Invasion Day, please do some research.  
-Nobody living in Australia is denying the past.  
We are all well aware of the past.  
However Australia Day to Australians has nothing to do with that.  
It is about our unity to be together as one and always going forward.

I experienced the WORST customer service today at a shop. I don't want to mention the name of the shop because I'm not sure how I'm going to proceed. Last night I bought something from this shop. I paid cash for it. I took it home and found out it didn't work. So today, less than 24 hours later I took it back to the shop and asked if I could get a refund. The girl in the shop told me “NO” even though I still had the receipt. I asked if I could get a replacement instead then. Again this person told me ""NO."" I asked to talk to a manager now as I'm really not happy and I explained that I had just bought the item, had got it home and it didn't work. The manager just smiled and told me to my face that I was ""OUT OF LUCK."" 😡😡😡

No refund.
No FREE replacement. Grrrrrrrrr...

It is the most eloquent and succinct exposition of the anti-Israel movement I’ve ever seen. Hamas executed six hostages point blank as IDF was closing in. Israel did it. Why would they execute the people they’re coming to rescue? Why would they rescue hostages in other bold raids but execute these ones? Why is Clem denying something that Hamas isn’t? Don’t know. Who even cares. Let’s ignore everything and make up whatever suits us. 

October 7 was a false flag or it wasn’t but Israel deserved it anyway. There were no rapes or maybe there were but Israeli soldiers rape everyone or they don’t but only because they think Arab women are beneath them. The resistance is winning, glory to the intifada and also it’s a genocide. The Arabs were right to reject the 1947 partition plan and wage war against the European colonisers but also the Zionists started it and ethnically cleansed the peaceful Palestinians who literally begged the Jews to come from Nazi-occupied Europe. Ok maybe Jews do come from Israel but today’s Jews aren’t really Jews anyway. 

You wonder why rational arguments, empathy and willingness to compromise doesn’t convince these people? It’s because you’re dealing with cretins and psychopaths.","2024-09-04T13:22:36.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWopnnaakAE4iw5.jpg""]","https://x.com/AlexRyvchin/status/1831321970409119790","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,65,93,475,14568,,,22466,"Author.

I know that Jewish Australians who have a long and proud tradition of contribution to Australian football will agree. Foster’s legal arguments about the International Court of Justice and the claim of genocide are plainly wrong and his assertions about universal human rights are manipulative and misleading. After the democratically elected government of Gaza invaded Israel and committed war crimes of a scale and barbarity that shocked the world, Foster made no call for Palestine’s suspension from FIFA. Worst of all is the callous disregard for the welfare of the Israeli people still badly wounded from October 7, still tormented by war on multiple fronts, still hoping for release of their loved ones held captive. Sport provides momentary respite from life’s stresses and horrors and Foster’s nonchalant attempt to deny this to Israelis is a low move.","2024-05-16T22:58:43.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GNvFA7KacAAVVcz.jpg""]","https://x.com/AlexRyvchin/status/1791241902706303484","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}","[{""profile_id"":""59067938"",""profile_name"":""Craig Foster"",""url"":""https://x.com/Craig_Foster"",""biography"":null,""is_verified"":null,""following"":null,""followers"":null}]",413,62,400,28968,,,22466,"Author.

It favoured the idea of a liberated Ottoman colony which had been held by various foreign empires for 2,000 years, becoming an independent Jewish state at the same time as new Arab states were being created in other territories previously held by the defeated Ottomans. Syria, Lebanon, Iraq were created in the same process. An Arab state in Palestine was created in the form of Transjordan (later Jordan) in 1921. 

A second Arab state in Palestine was offered in 1937 and duly rejected because it would have also meant a Jewish state existing on just 4% of historic Palestine.

"1730771111611338764","AlexRyvchin","Alex Ryvchin","I want to say thank you to @clementine_ford. Earlier this year, my book on antisemitism called, “The 7 Deadly Myths - Antisemitism from the time of Christ to Kanye West” was released. 

Today, Clementine performed a one woman, all caps pantomime of the book. It was a thing of beauty to see the myths through which hatred of Jews is conveyed, elegantly presented in a single post. 

1. Jewish “bloodlust” and “child killers”. The notion that Jews have a thirst for blood and torture and murder children originated from medieval Europe. See Simon of Trent and Little Hugh of Lincoln. (Detailed in chapter 1 - Blood Libel. 

2. “You are not the victims” and Jews are white and pretend not to be. The Black Hebrew Israelites claim Jews are white imposters that pretend to be Jews. Nazis claim we pretend to be white. The notion that Jews are not persecuted but in fact the greatest threat to the world is a cornerstone of antisemitism used to justify further attacks on Jews as righteous acts of self-defence. (Detailed in Chapter 7 - Oppressed to Oppressors). 

3. “You’ve exceptionalised yourselves.” (Chapter 5 - Chosen. The belief that Jews think they’re superior to others is based on a deliberate distortion of the biblical “chosen” status). 

Ford presents us with the mythologised version of the Jew. What Philip Roth called our doppelgänger that entered the consciousness of the West in place of the real Jew. Ford creates a monster just to have something to slay. But who is she targeting? Almost exclusively Jewish women living in Australia. She has convinced herself they are some demonic child-killing, bloodthirsty, malevolent element in our midst, which she predictably and derivatively calls the “Zionist”. She then directs all her fury at them. It is the same pathology as Henry Ford, Pavel Krushevan and other antisemites catalogued in my book. 

Throw in the obsession with Jewish race (skin colour, bloodline etc) and denial of antisemitism and you have a specimen worthy of a textbook. 

Thank you Clementine for co-writing this new edition with me. You have explained antisemitism and how it rots the brain, better than I ever could.

Sharab came to Australia on a visa from Gaza

He has been charged with alleged kidnapping &amp; threats to kill

Sharab also seemingly regards Hamas Terrorists as heroes, recently saying “Long Live Hamas”

Should his visa be cancelled ?

Dana is in Australia on a student visa

What unfolded because of those hurty words is astounding. It’s a long story but essentially one mum got hunted down by the school for saying those words at a private pre-school breakfast, kids detained for 2.5 hours without food and water, interrogated, shouted at and then denied play time at lunch afterwards. They were then stripped of their graduation medals and the teachers refused to do a farewell speech.

I didn’t get a call about it but other parents did.

Does that seem a reasonable response to a few kids writing FU [insert school name] on their shirts?

I’ve emailed the DoE demanding an investigation into why they fucked up my son’s last day of primary school. I copied the principal in so I could fuck up her holidays.

Imagine our lives without steel, clothing, furniture, plastics, carpets, medicines, electrical equipment, roads, cars, tractors, trucks, trains, planes, bricks, curtains etc etc all exist only because of fossil fuels are ingredients or are a critical part of the manufacturing process. 

If you live in a house, drive a car, use public transport or ride a bicycle, you're a hypocrite. If you use electricity, or a mobile phone, computer or even watch TV, you're a hypocrite.

Then there's the climate change part of your argument. Further evidence that you do not know what you're talking about.

96% of all CO2 emissions occur naturally. Humans are responsible for just 4% of all CO2 emissions. And you think the 4% is causing global warming. Dead set, you're a fvcking idiot. The next thing you fail to understand, which every high school student knows, is that CO2 is released when temperatures increase, and CO2 is absorbed when temperatures decrease. CO2 increases follow temperature increases. Therefore, it is scientifically impossible for CO2 to cause warming. FFS you climate alarmists are so stupid. Everyone knows that climate change is a hoax. It's a money grab by global elites and is being propped up around the world by retards like you.

Jobs in nuclear power pay 50% more than jobs in wind and solar.

"1899225288971538876","DrewPavlou","Drew Pavlou 🇦🇺🇪🇺🇺🇦🇹🇼","MY WEEK AT THE FRONT

I just got back to Kyiv after a short trip to the frontline in Kherson and the Donbas. 

Early in the week I walked through the kill zone in Kherson. Here the Russians have been killing or maiming up to 20 Ukrainian civilians a day with FPV drones - the drones literally just drop grenades on people in the street. The Russians film these atrocities and proudly boast about them on Telegram where they call this horror a “human safari.” Two days before I went to Kherson the Russians dropped grenades on a bus and killed 5 people. Old Ukrainian grandmothers had their legs and arms torn off by shrapnel. This is the reality of Russia’s barbaric and genocidal campaign against Ukraine. 

In Kherson I went within about 250 meters of the river which is a death zone. We were approximately 1000 meters back from Russian positions on the other side of the Dnipro river. Russian artillery strikes against the city were constant and the rumble of the Russian guns filled the air like thunder. At one point some Russian tank rounds landed a few blocks away from us. I walked through street after street of abandoned buildings - it was extremely eerie, like walking through a post-apocalyptic setting. The only sounds were the crunch of shattered glass underfoot and the far off thunder of Russian guns. 

In the Donbas I recorded the direct aftermath of the Dobropillya Massacre. The Russians struck a residential apartment block, an old  five story Khrushchevka building. 14 dead and 50 injured - slaughtered and maimed in their beds while at sleep. I documented the aftermath of the carnage some 36 hours after the massacre took place. 

Tragically I think the ultimate death toll will be much higher. I walked through apartments that were completely incinerated. There was absolutely zero chance of survival near ground zero - the crater from just one of the Iskander ballistic missile hits was almost 10 meters deep. I found shards of glass as big as my arm strewn throughout the children’s playground right next to the disaster zone - the force of the explosion would have sent these massive shards of glass flying through the air like bullets. 

To make this war crime even more heinous the Russians carried out a “double tap” strike against the first responders with banned cluster munitions. They first perfected this war crime during the Syrian Civil War. I filmed shrapnel indentations in nearby walls, massive chunks of concrete gouged out of buildings for hundreds of meters in all directions. Direct evidence of Russian war crimes. 

I will post all this footage to YouTube and publish my thoughts about what I saw on my Substack.

The two nurses in West Sydney who said they wanted to kill Jews under their care were not neo-Nazis. They were Islamist extremists.

Not a single Australian politician will say this though because nobody will ever call out Islamist anti-Semitism.

"1899628187652595717","Joey1800callme","Joey Mate™️ 🇦🇺 🇳🇱","In Australia, Housing Policy—or the lack of it—has become a festering issue, rippling through the economy like a bad hangover.  

IMHO this has been the #1 Driver behind many, if not all, of the economic woes we are experiencing in Australia, including the rapidly rising cost of living and operating businesses, and has had significant societal impacts such as necessitating both parents to work (breakdown of family unit), a reduction in birth rates, increase in crime rates (especially youth), and homelessness.

Decades of half-baked plans, political posturing, and inaction have left the country with a supply crunch, skyrocketing prices, and a generation locked out of homeownership. 

Let’s break it down.

The core problem is simple: demand for housing has outstripped supply for years. Population growth—fueled by immigration, which successive governments have leaned on to prop up GDP—hasn’t been matched by new homes. ABS data shows Australia’s population hit 27 million in 2023, growing at 2.4% annually, one of the fastest rates in the developed world. Meanwhile, dwelling completions have flatlined—around 170,000 per year since 2017, according to the Housing Industry Association, nowhere near enough to keep pace.

Policy failures have piled up. The Howard era pumped up demand with generous tax breaks like negative gearing and capital gains discounts, turning housing into a speculator’s playground. Prices doubled between 1999 and 2010, per CoreLogic, and never looked back. Labor and Coalition governments alike have since tinkered around the edges—think first-home buyer grants or stamp duty tweaks—but these just juice demand and prices further without fixing supply. The result? Median house prices in Sydney and Melbourne are now 9-10 times median household income, compared to 3-4 times in the 1980s.

Supply-side efforts have been a joke. State governments, which control planning and zoning, have choked development with red tape and NIMBY-friendly rules. The Grattan Institute reckons restrictive zoning has slashed potential housing stock by up to 20% in major cities. Federally, there’s been no real muscle to coordinate or fund infrastructure—roads, schools, transport—that’d make new housing estates viable. The Albanese government’s “Homes for Australia” plan promises 1.2 million homes by 2029, but it’s light on details and already behind schedule, with builders citing labor shortages and rising costs.

The economic fallout is brutal. Housing affordability is tanking—rental vacancy rates are below 1% in most capitals, per SQM Research, driving rents up 20-30% since 2020. Young people are stuck renting or living with parents, crushing household formation and consumer spending. Productivity takes a hit too; workers can’t afford to live near jobs, so commutes stretch and businesses struggle to hire. The Reserve Bank’s stuck between a rock and a hard place—rate hikes to cool inflation slam mortgage holders, but low rates just inflate the bubble more. And don’t get me started on wealth inequality—property now accounts for 60% of household wealth, per ABS, leaving non-owners in the dust.

Governments have dodged the hard calls—reforming tax incentives, smashing zoning bottlenecks, or pouring cash into social housing (which is at a pitiful 4% of stock, down from 7% in the 1990s). Instead, they’ve kicked the can, banking on the “housing wealth effect” to keep voters happy. But that game’s running out of steam. Without a proper fix—think German-style planning overhaul or Singapore’s public housing model—this mess will keep dragging Australia down.

Whoever comes up with an acceptable solution is going to be winning the next election.  They had better include a much stronger policy on migration, worker skilling, and foreign ownership and reject the decade long trend of appeasing the woketards that are destroying this nation.

One thing is for sure, Australia as a first world nation cannot have its own citizens living in their cars, tents, or worse, on the street.","2025-03-12T01:07:07.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GlzViXobIAAhUzM.png""]","https://x.com/Joey1800callme/status/1899628187652595717","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,3,6,29,1804,,,12442,"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo, Cogito ergo sum, Non ducor, duco, Oderint dum metuant, NO DM's🌸 Postnoun: MATE, Aus Day = 26th Jan, Binfluencer",124923,"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1819612665100357633/7wzgRNus_normal.jpg",7561,false,0,1,"{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null}",,,,"2025-03-15T18:51:40.129Z","{""url"":""https://twitter.com/1367237024395104256/status/1899628187652595717""}","{""url"":""https://x.com/Joey1800callme"",""start_date"":""2023-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"",""end_date"":""""}",,,,

“HOT ENOUGH FOR YA.. 🥵

A Diary extract of an Australian Southerner moving to Northern Queensland.. 🇦🇺

August 31st 

Just got transferred with work into our new home in Queensland!! 

Now this is a place that knows how to live!! Beautiful sunny days and warm balmy evenings. What a place! I watched the sunset from a deck chair on the verandah. It was beautiful. I've finally found my home. I love it here.
 
September 13th:
 
Really heating up. Got to 35 today. Not a problem. Live in an air-conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun everyday like this. I'm turning into a sun worshiper.
 
September 30th:
 
Had the backyard landscaped with tropical plants today. Lots of palms and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing lawn for me. Another scorcher today, but I love it here.
 
October 10th
 
The temperature hasn't been below 30 all week. How do people get used to this kind of heat? At least today it's kind of windy though, but getting used to the heat and humidity is taking longer that I expected.
 
October 15th:
 
Fell asleep by the pool. Got 3rd degree burns over 60% of my body. Missed 3 days of work. What a daft thing to do. I learnt my lesson though. Got to respect the ol' sun in a climate like this.
 
October 20th:
 
I didn't see Kitty our cat, sneaking into the car before I left this morning. By the time I got to the hot car at lunchtime, Kitty had died and swollen up to the size of a shopping bag and stank out $3,000 worth of leather upholstery. I told the kids that she ran away. The car now smells like Wiskettes and cat shit. I learnt my lesson though. No more pets in this heat.
 
October 25th:
 
The wind gives me the shits. It feels like a giant bloody blow dryer!! And it's as hot as hell. The air conditioner is on the blink and the AC repairman charged $250 just to drive over and tell me he needed to order parts.
 
October 30th:
 
Been sleeping outside by the pool for 3 nights now. Bloody $1,700,000 house and we can't even go inside. Why did I ever come here?
 
November 4th:
 
It's 35 degrees. Finally got the ol' air-conditioner fixed today. It cost $2,500 and gets the temperature down to 25, but this bloody humidity makes the house feel like it's about 30. Stupid repairman. I hate this bloody place.
 
November 8th:
 
If another smartarse says, ""Hot enough for you today?"" I'm going to throttle him. Bloody heat. By the time I get to work the car's radiator is boiling over, my clothes are soaking wet, and I smell like baked cat!!
 
November 9th :
 
Tried to run some errands after work. Wore shorts, and sat on the black leather seats in the ol' car. I thought my arse was on fire. I lost 2 layers of flesh and all the hair on the back of my legs. Now my car smells like burnt hair, fried arse, and baked cat.
 
November 10th:
 
The weather report might as well be a bloody recording. Hot and sunny. Hot and sunny. Hot and sunny. It's been too hot to do anything for 2 damn months and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. Doesn't it ever rain in this damn place? Water rationing will be next, so my $4,000 worth of palms will dry up and blow into the bloody pool. Even the palms can't live in this heat.
 
November 14th:
 
Welcome to HELL!!! Temperature got to 38 today. Now the air conditioner in my car has gone. The repairman came to fix it and said, ""Hot enough for you today?"" My wife had to spend the $5,000 house payment to bail my arse out of jail for assaulting the repairman. Bloody Queensland. What kind of a sick demented idiot would want to live here?
 
December 1st:

Just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her.
""You have so much to live for,"" said the man.
""I'm a sailor, and we are off to Italy tomorrow. I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take care of you, bring you food every day and keep you happy.""

With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to Italy , the woman accepted.

That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.

From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine and make love to her until dawn.

Two weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.
""What are you doing here?"" asked the captain.
""I have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""He brings me food and I get a free trip to Italy .""
""I see,"" the captain said.
Her conscience got the best of her and she added, ""Plus, he's screwing me.""
""He certainly is,"" replied the captain.
""This is the Manly Ferry.""","2025-01-05T01:03:35.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GgfcBVja8AM70l1.jpg""]","https://x.com/Joey1800callme/status/1875709697124360670","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,176,173,1294,57712,,,12441,"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo, Cogito ergo sum, Non ducor, duco, Oderint dum metuant, NO DM's🌸 Postnoun: MATE, Aus Day = 26th Jan, Binfluencer",124923,"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1819612665100357633/7wzgRNus_normal.jpg",7561,false,29,102,"{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null}",,,,"2025-03-15T18:51:43.847Z","{""url"":""https://twitter.com/1367237024395104256/status/1875709697124360670""}","{""url"":""https://x.com/Joey1800callme"",""start_date"":""2023-10-07T00:00:00.000Z"",""end_date"":""""}",,,,

The technician kindly explained to me that this was a “SMART UTE” and the radio was “VOICE-ACTIVATED”.
He turned the radio on and said, “Nelson” to the radio.
The radio replied, “Ricky or Willy?” “Willy” he continued and ‘On the road again’ came on the speakers.
Then he said “AC/DC”, and in an instant, ‘Highway to hell’ took the place of Willy Nelson.

I drove away happy and for the next few days every time I said “Pink Floyd” I would get classic Floyd or if I said “Beatles” I would get one of their greatest hits.

Well, yesterday, a fella ran a red light and nearly smashed into my new ute but luckily I swerved in time to avoid it.

I yelled out “YOU FUCKING IDIOT!”
And the radio said, “Daniel Andrews or Anthony Albanese?”

Before the Security detail guys could get to him, 3 kids who were fishing pulled him out of the water. 
 
He was so grateful he offered the kids whatever they wanted. 
 
The first kid said, 'I want to go to Movie World in QLD'
Albo said, 'No problem, I'll take you there on my special Prime Minister's airplane.'

The second kid said, 'I want a new pair of Speedo 'SHARK' bathers.'
Albo said, 'I'll get them for you, and even have Ian Thorpe sign them!'

The third kid said, 'I want a motorised wheelchair with a built in TV and stereo headset!'

When he’s called over to the teller, he says, ""Good morning, could you please cash this cheque for me?""

The teller replied, ""It would be my pleasure sir. Could you please show me your ID?""

Anthony Albanese said, ""Truthfully, I didn’t bring my ID with me as I didn't think there was any need to. I’m the Pwime Minista & leader of the Labour Party of Australia.""

The teller said, ""Yes sir, I know who you are... but with all the regulations and monitoring of the banks because of impostors, forgers, and requirements of the legislation etc., I must insist on seeing ID.""

Albo said, “Just ask anyone here at the bank who I am and they’ll tell you. Everybody knows who I am.""

The teller said, ""I’m sorry, Mr Albanese, but these are the bank rules and I must follow them""

Getting a bit agitated, Albanese  snapped, “C'mon woman, I’m urging you, please, to cash this cheque..""

The teller said, ""Look Mr Albanese, here is an example of what we can do. One day, Tiger Woods came into the bank without ID. To prove he was Tiger Woods, he pulled out his putter and made a beautiful shot across the bank into a cup. With that shot we knew him to be Tiger Woods and cashed his cheque.

""Another time, Andre Agassi came in without ID. He pulled out his tennis racket and made a fabulous shot where the tennis ball landed in my cup. With that shot we cashed his cheque. So, Mr Albanese , what can you do to prove that it is you, and only you?""

Anthony Albanese stands there thinking, and thinking, and finally says, ""Honestly, my mind is a total blank... there’s nothing that comes to my mind. I can't think of a single thing. I have absolutely no idea what to do... and I don't have a clue.""

"1893952485976355176","AlboMP","Anthony Albanese","Today marks three years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

For three years, Ukraine has bravely resisted Russia’s illegal and immoral war of aggression.

Australia mourns the loss of life of Ukraine’s citizens and defenders, and the generational toll of Russia’s brutality.

Australia continues to stand with Ukraine.

We have committed over $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through vital equipment for the battlefield and the training of Ukrainian forces.

Australia has been clear since day one that Russia, and those enabling its illegal invasion, will face consequences.

The Australian Government has today imposed further targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on 70 persons, and targeted financial sanctions on 79 entities.

This constitutes Australia’s largest sanctions package since February 2022.

The new sanctions target individuals propping up Russia’s illegal administrations in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, including so-called “ministers”, judges and prosecutors, and individuals responsible for conflict-related sexual violence and the forced deportation of Ukrainian children.

The sanctions also target persons and entities involved in deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, including the deployment of North Korean troops to the battlefield.

Deepening Russia-North Korea military cooperation is a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security.

Targets in Russia’s defence, transport and finance sectors, and those spreading disinformation to undermine Ukraine and governments around the world, have also been sanctioned.

Australia has now imposed a total of more than 1,400 sanctions in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Government has taken decisive action to ensure Australians are not inadvertently fuelling Russia’s war economy.

Today we have further tightened trade bans on Russia by prohibiting the supply of commercial drones and components, including the provision of related services.

Once again, Australia calls on Russia to immediately end its war and adhere fully to its obligations under international law, including in relation to the protection of civilians and treatment of prisoners of war.

Working with Ukraine and our partners, Australia supports a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.

By the time the sirens sounded, the bombs were already falling.

Our nation, once so safe in our geographical isolation, felt the full brunt of a relentless enemy.

The attack was led by the same commander who had led the attack on Pearl Harbor. More than 260 aircraft came roaring in, dropping nearly 700 bombs.

Amid the fear and the confusion, our servicemen fired back with whatever they could lay their hands on, even if it was just a revolver.

There was such desperation, suffering and destruction, but what stood tallest was their extraordinary courage.

Thanks to them, Darwin stood.

Over Japan’s nearly two-year campaign and 64 air raids, the defenders of our great northern city responded with courage, resilience and resolve.

They withstood an empire.

After a decorated VFL/AFL career as a player and coach, in 2013, Neale was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. 

Neale’s battle against what he calls “the Beast” has brought new hope and inspiration into the lives of everyone affected by MND and it has won him the boundless admiration of all Australians.

Neale is a co-founder of FightMND which has raised over $100 million to fund vital research  and has made the “Big Freeze” an iconic part of the AFL season.

Neale’s extraordinary story is not about what MND has taken from him, it’s about all that Neale has given: to our awareness of this disease and to the cause of finding a cure.

Neale is fond of the saying “When all is said and done, more is said than done.” 

It is hard to think of anyone who has done more than Neale in the service of others.  

Congratulations to Neale and his remarkable family.

Jimmy Carter was a person of deep faith and a true humanitarian who dedicated his post-Presidential life to eradicating disease, preventing conflict, tackling poverty and campaigning for human rights.

In all this, his late wife Rosalynn was always his essential partner and his strongest supporter. 

Former President Carter rose from humble beginnings to leave a remarkable legacy. Beyond being elected to the Presidency or being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter's legacy is best measured in lives changed, saved and uplifted. 

People living free from debilitating disease because of the work of The Carter Center. People with a safe home to call their own, thanks to all those he inspired to contribute to Habitat for Humanity. People spared the toll of conflict because of his tireless efforts as a negotiator.

And today we take our relationship with Solomon Islands to a new level, by providing support to grow the size of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. 

This partnership will strengthen Solomon Islands’ domestic security and will enhance its ability to contribute to regional stability. 

It affirms Australia as Solomon Islands' security partner of choice. 

Prime Minister Manele and I make this announcement today from Honiara and Canberra.

Because we are stronger and more secure when we act together.

Under my Government, Australia will be the partner for Solomon Islands we always should have been.

Only 21 people have had the extraordinary privilege of serving as Leader of Australia’s oldest political party. 

Bill took over in 2013, united the party, re-energised the Caucus and rebuilt Labor into a strong opposition and a genuine alternative government.  

Through his years as leader, no-one worked harder than Bill, no-one brought more energy, enthusiasm, ideas and ambition to advocating for a Labor Government. 

It’s a measure of Bill’s character that he channelled the disappointment of 2019 into fighting for justice for the victims of Robodebt. 

@billshortenmp has dedicated so much of his career to building and strengthening the NDIS, and he's determined to see it through.

I’ve asked Bill to remain in Cabinet until he goes because I want him to finish the vital work he is undertaking on the NDIS, to secure the best possible outcome for people with disability, their families and carers.

We're  building more homes for renters, homes for first-home buyers, homes for the most vulnerable in our community, because the more homes we build,  the more affordable housing becomes.","2024-12-15T21:48:26.000Z","[""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ge3u6yyawAAwzA_.jpg""]","https://x.com/ClareONeilMP/status/1868412828954296402","{""post_id"":null,""profile_id"":null,""profile_name"":null,""data_posted"":null,""url"":null,""description"":null,""photos"":null,""videos"":null}",,644,156,451,82974,,,37688,"MP for Hotham.
